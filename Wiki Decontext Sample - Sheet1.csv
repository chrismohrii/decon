imp,"Military history of Brazil [HEAD] Modern Brazil ; World War II [SEP] The Brazilian pilots initially flew from 31 October 1944 as individual elements of flights of the 350th FG US squadrons, at first in affiliation flights and progressively taking part in more dangerous missions. Less than two weeks later, on 11 November, the Group started its own operations, flying from its base at Tarquinia, using its call-sign Jambock. The Group was divided into four flights, Vermelha (Red), Amarela (Yellow), Azul (Blue) and Verde (Green). Each flight had a complement of roughly 12 pilots, these having been flying together since their training spell in Panama. A pilot customarily wore an echarpe in the colours of his flight. The CO of the Group and some officers were not attached to any specific flight. Initially the P-47s were finished in standard US fighter colours, olive-drab (top surfaces) and neutral grey (undersurfaces), except the aircraft of the commanding officer, which was finished in natural metal and olive-drab anti-glare panels. Contrary to common belief, the first aircraft flown by the group's operations officer (coded ""2"") was also painted in the OD/NG color-scheme, being lost in action when Lt. Danilo Moura was shot down, being replaced by an overall natural metal finish (NMF) aircraft, which was later also shot down when flown by Lt. Luis Lopes Dornelles and replaced by a third NMF machine. The badge of the Group was painted just after the engine cowling, and the aircraft code (flight letter-aircraft number) was in white letters over the cowling. National insignia was in four positions, this being the US star-and-bar, with the white star replaced by the Brazilian star. Later, replacement aircraft were in natural metal, with olive-drab anti-glare panels, the codes being in black. The Brazilian pilots had been trained in the US for fighter operations — but the Luftwaffe had by then nearly no airplanes in Italy. Thus the 1ºGAVCA started its fighting career as a fighter-bomber unit, its missions being armed reconnaissance and interdiction, in support of the US 5th Army, to which the Brazilian Expeditionary Force was attached. On 16 April 1945, the U.S. Fifth Army started its offensive along the Po Valley. On this date, the Group was reduced to 25 pilots, some having been killed and others, having been shot down, becoming POWs. Also, some had been relieved from operations on medical grounds due to combat fatigue. The Yellow flight was thus disbanded, its remaining pilots being distributed among the other flights. Each pilot flew on average two missions a day. On 19 April, the German frontline was broken, this having been first signalled to Command HQ by the Group. The Allied forces had to set up bridgehead across the River Pó, before the German forces crossed it. This was to be done on the 23 April, after a softening up of the German defences by the Air Force on the previous day. On 22 April 1945, the day dawned cold, overcast and foggy. The three flights took off at five-minute intervals starting at 8:30 AM, to attack targets in the San Benedetto region, destroying bridges, barges and motorized vehicles. At 10:00 AM, a flight took off for an armed reconnaissance mission south of Mantua — more than 80 trucks and vehicles were destroyed. Other aircraft attacked fortified German positions, tanks and barges. By the end of the day, the Group had flown 44 individual missions, having destroyed more than a hundred vehicles as well as barges, etc. Two P - 47s were damaged and a third was shot down , its pilot , 2º Ten . - Av . Armando de S. Coelho, being taken prisoner. This was the day when more sorties than ever were made by the Group, and is commemorated each year as the Brazilian Fighter Arm Day.","Two P-47s were damaged and a third was shot down, its pilot, 2º Ten.-Av.","Two P-47s were damaged and a third was shot down, its pilot, 2º Ten.-Av.",,
un,"Cinema of France [HEAD] [SEP] French cinema comprises the art of film and creative movies made within the nation of France or by French filmmakers abroad. Several important cinematic movements, including the Nouvelle Vague, began in the country. It is noted for having a particularly strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the French government. Apart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland (Roman Polanski, Krzysztof Kieślowski, and Andrzej Żuławski), Argentina (Gaspar Noé and Edgardo Cozarinsky), Russia (Alexandre Alexeieff, Anatole Litvak), Austria (Michael Haneke), and Georgia (Géla Babluani, Otar Iosseliani) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as Luc Besson, Jacques Tourneur, or Francis Veber in the United States. Another element supporting this fact is that Paris has the highest density of cinemas in the world, measured by the number of movie theaters per inhabitant, and that in most ""downtown Paris"" movie theaters, foreign movies which would be secluded to ""art houses"" cinemas in other places are shown alongside ""mainstream"" works. Philippe Binant realized, on 2 February 2000, the first digital cinema projection in Europe, with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by Texas Instruments, in Paris. Paris also boasts the Cité du cinéma, a major studio north of the city, and Disney Studio, a theme park devoted to the cinema and the third theme park near the city behind Disneyland and Parc Asterix. France is the most successful film industry in Europe in terms of number of films produced per annum , with a record - breaking 300 feature - length films produced in 2015 . France is also one of the few countries where non-American productions have the biggest share: American films only represented 44.9% of total admissions in 2014. This is largely due to the commercial strength of domestic productions, which accounted for 44,5% of admissions in 2014 (35.5% in 2015; 35.3% in 2016). Also, the French film industry is closer to being entirely self-sufficient than any other country in Europe, recovering around 80–90% of costs from revenues generated in the domestic market alone. In 2013, France was the 2nd largest exporter of films in the world after the United States. A study in April 2014 showed the positive image which French cinema maintains around the world, being the most appreciated cinema after American cinema. A favorite theme has been the French Revolution, with hundreds of titles.","France is the most successful film industry in Europe in terms of number of films produced per annum, with a record-breaking 300 feature-length films produced in 2015.","France is the most successful film industry in Europe in terms of number of films produced per annum, with a record-breaking 300 feature-length films produced in 2015.",,
un,"1 for 7 Billion campaign [HEAD] Previous Selection Process [SEP] There is an informal regional rotation scheme for the selection of the UN Secretary - General , despite the absence of any provision in the Charter of the United Nations that specifies such a scheme . It is speculated that Eastern Europe is a strong contender in the 2016 appointment as it is the only region from which a Secretary-General has never before been selected. Article 97 of the United Nations Charter guides the selection procedure stating that “the Secretary-General is appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council”. In practice, one candidate is chosen in private by the Security Council without discussing with member states or publishing a list of candidates. It is UN Security Council practice that the five permanent members of the Security Council – the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia and China – have an effective veto over the selection during this stage of the process, though this is not explicitly mentioned in the United Nations Charter. The final candidate is then submitted to the General Assembly for ratification. No candidate has ever been rejected by the General Assembly. The appointment of the first UN Secretary-General, Trygve Lie, in 1945 saw a different selection process to that of his successors. Following his recommendation by the Security Council, the General Assembly held a secret ballot which saw Lie elected with 46 votes to three. The General Assembly also took an atypically prominent role in the re-appointment process deciding to extend Lie’s term by majority vote in light of the Security Council being unable to agree on a recommendation for the next Secretary-General.","There is an informal regional rotation scheme for the selection of the UN Secretary-General, despite the absence of any provision in the Charter of the United Nations that specifies such a scheme.","There is an informal regional rotation scheme for the selection of the UN Secretary-General, despite the absence of any provision in the Charter of the United Nations that specifies such a scheme.",,
un,"Ancient Indian architecture [HEAD] Classical period (320 BCE – 550 CE) ; Rock-cut caves [SEP] Around the same time rock-cut architecture began to develop, starting with the already highly sophisticated and state-sponsored Barabar caves in Bihar, personally dedicated by Ashoka c. 250 BCE. These artificial caves exhibit an amazing level of technical proficiency, the extremely hard granite rock being cut in geometrical fashion and polished to a mirror-like finish. Probably owing to the 2nd century BCE fall of the Mauryan Empire and the subsequent persecutions of Buddhism under Pushyamitra Sunga, it is thought that many Buddhists relocated to the Deccan under the protection of the Andhra dynasty, thus shifting the cave-building effort to western India: an enormous effort at creating religious caves (usually Buddhist or Jain) continued there until the 2nd century CE, culminating with the Karla Caves or the Pandavleni Caves. These caves generally followed an apsidal plan with a stupa in the back for the chaityas, and a rectangular plan with surrounding cells for the viharas. As well as royal patronage, numerous donors provided the funds for the building of these caves and left donation inscriptions, including laity, members of the clergy, government officials, and even foreigners. The construction of caves would wane after the 2nd century CE, possibly due to the rise of Mahayana Buddhism and the associated intense architectural and artistic production in Gandhara and Amaravati. The building of rock - cut caves would revive briefly in the 5th century CE , with the magnificent achievements of Ajanta and Ellora , before finally subsiding as Hinduism replaced Buddhism in the sub - continent , and stand - alone temples became more prevalent . Rock-cut architecture also developed with the apparition of stepwells in India, dating from 200 to 400 CE. Subsequently, the construction of wells at Dhank (550–625 CE) and stepped ponds at Bhinmal (850–950 CE) took place. Jain cave monastery in Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves (2nd century BCE).

done,"Stephen Hymer [HEAD] Contributions [SEP] Stephen Hymer is considered to be the father of International Business due to his contributions related to Foreign Direct Investment as well as his studies and academic production on the field of theories of multinational enterprises. Hymer's main contributions, which predated most of today's existing theory on the subjects of multinational enterprises and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), are collected in eleven documents, including his 1960 doctoral thesis. Before his theory on FDI, all investments were considered to be mere capital movements across borders. These movements of capital were thought to be determined mainly by the differences in interest rates between the countries. Hymer established that there was a distinction between financial investments and these kinds of investments, which he named Foreign Direct Investment: the latter gives the firm control over the business activities in other countries whereas portfolio investment does not. The theory presented by Stephen Hymer is considered a departure from neo-classical perspective and the consideration of a perfect market structure. Hymer's main conclusion is that foreign direct investment can only succeed as long as there are market imperfections that can create advantages and conflicts: companies could reduce their competition by implementing foreign direct investment. In this way, companies can eliminate the arising conflicts in the market and benefit from their specific advantages. Hymer considered multinational firms to be better institutions than actual international markets in the process of stimulating business, and for information transmitting as well as price fixing. This was all elaborated by Dunning and Pitelis in the academic paper: ""Stephen Hymer's Contribution to International Business Scholarship: An assessment and extension"". In the analysis of the nature and causes of foreign investment , Stephen Herbert Hymer made a distinction between direct and portfolio investment . After ascertaining that differences in interest rates cause portfolio investments, but not direct investments, and that the industrial distribution of the latter is not significantly different from one country to another, as could be expected if their cause was solely differences in profitability, Hymer concluded that direct investments are capital movements associated to international operations of firms. Their goal is to keep control of production. This control allows either to suppress competition, or appropriate rents derived from advantages like skilled labour, cheap raw materials, access to capital markets or technology. Later, Hymer used Marxian language and concepts more explicitly. In a series of articles published in the 1970s, he considered the relationship between nation-states and multinational firms, detailing their role in the creation of an international division of labor. Hymer argued that this hierarchal division of labor was a macrocosm of the internal division of labor reproduced within the multinational corporation. Hymer did not believe that these firms had become more powerful than nation-states; instead, multinationals were firmly rooted in the major financial centers of the world, and they tended to reinforce existing geographic and spatial boundaries and dependencies. Papers and articles on this and various other topics articles were compiled by Hymer's graduate students from the New School for Social Research in The Multinational Corporation: A Radical Approach. Papers by Stephen Herbert Hymer, published by Cambridge University Press in 1979. Hymer's theories have strongly influenced other economists, like Cantwell and Dunning, and were elaborated by Hymer's dissertation advisor, Charles P. Kindleberger in American Business Abroad, series of lectures published in 1969. The latter played an important role in the posthumous publication of Hymer's dissertation. Many authors have used Hymer's theories to develop new theoretical approaches in the field of international business. One of these new theories is the OLI paradigm (ownership-location-internalization) also known as the eclectic paradigm, developed by John Dunning (1977), which adopts Hymer's firms' specific advantages.","In the analysis of the nature and causes of foreign investment, Hymer made a distinction between direct and portfolio investment.","In the analysis of the nature and causes of foreign investment, Stephen Herbert Hymer made a distinction between direct and portfolio investment.",n,Hallucinated middle name

Sexism, racism, female genital mutilation, child labour, human trafficking, and the political marginalization of largely southern-based ethnic groups continued to be problems. Homosexuality is illegal and is a capital offence in Mauritania. Following the 2008 coup , the military government of Mauritania faced severe international sanctions and internal unrest . Amnesty International accused it of practicing coordinated torture against criminal and political detainees. Amnesty has accused the Mauritanian legal system, both before and after the 2008 coup, of functioning with complete disregard for legal procedure, fair trial, or humane imprisonment. The organization has said that the Mauritanian government has practiced institutionalized and continuous use of torture throughout its post-independence history, under all its leaders. Amnesty International in 2008 alleged that torture was common in Mauritania, stating that its usage is ""deeply anchored in the culture of the security forces"", which use it ""as a system of investigation and repression"". Forms of torture employed include cigarette burns, electric shocks and sexual violence, stated Amnesty International. In 2014, the United States Department of State identified torture by Mauritanian law enforcement as one of the ""central human rights problems"" in the country. Juan E. Méndez, an independent expert on human rights from the United Nations, reported in 2016 that legal protections against torture were present but not applied in Mauritania, pointing to an ""almost total absence of investigations into allegations of torture"". According to the US State Department 2010 Human Rights Report, abuses in Mauritania include: ...mistreatment of detainees and prisoners; security force impunity; lengthy pretrial detention; harsh prison conditions; arbitrary arrests; limits on freedom of the press and assembly; corruption; discrimination against women; female genital mutilation (FGM); child marriage; political marginalization of southern-based ethnic groups; racial and ethnic discrimination; slavery and slavery-related practices; and child labor.","Following the 2008 coup, the military government of Mauritania faced severe international sanctions and internal unrest.","Following the 2008 coup, the military government of Mauritania faced severe international sanctions and internal unrest.",,

In 1912 , construction of St Mary ' s Church was finished and the first Mass was said in the church on 7 April 1912 . Construction was halted then because of a disagreement because Broderick wanted the sanctuary built first, instead of Hopper's plans of building a tower. When the church was opened, a tower was built, but the east side of the church with its fittings were left unfinished. The architect was Percy Aidan Lamb. In 1907, not long before being commissioned to design St Mary's Church, he started his architectural firm in London. Before that he trained with Edward Goldie. From 1895 to 1907, he worked for John Francis Bentley on the construction of Westminster Cathedral. He built St Mary's Church in the Gothic Revival style with Arts and Crafts movement influences.

There are more than 3,500 Tibetan refugees residing in the Changtang region who depend primarily on livestock, with agriculture being their secondary occupation. These nomads were organized into the Tibetan refugee settlements in 1977 by the Central Tibetan Administration, Dharamsala, with help from Government of India and the state government at nine different places: Nyoma, Kagshung, Goyul, Hanley, Sumdho, Samedh, Karnag, Chushul and Churmur. These settlements are scattered across the high-altitude plateau with an average elevation of 4,700 metres (15,400 ft). The temperature in the region varies from −5 to −35 °C (23 to −31 °F) in winter and up to a maximum of 30 °C (86 °F) in summer. Large areas of Changtang are semi - arid , with very little vegetation growth in the whole region . Agricultural lands and pastures are confined to limited areas along the riverbanks (Yatoo et al., 2014). The average snowfall is less than 10 mm (0.39 in) occurring usually during the months of December, January and February. Unusual and excess snowfall as happened in March 2012, can be fatal to the livestock of the nomads. Sometimes, goats and sheep cannot get access to the grass for grazing for period up to 15 days. This constitutes the most critical part of the year for the nomads (Yatoo et al., 2014). Education in Ladakh is looked after entirely by the SOS Tibetan Children Village, one of the non-profit institutions providing education to the Tibetan children. There is a facility for crèche to tenth standard. Most of students attend day school, but there are also boarding facilities for very poor students and those from nomadic camps. Almost all children get a chance to go to school, and the general education level of the children is fairly good.

In the 19th century, albatross colonies, particularly those in the North Pacific, were harvested for the feather trade, leading to the near-extinction of the short-tailed albatross. Of the 21 albatross species recognised by IUCN on their Red List, 19 are threatened, and the other two are near threatened. Three species (as recognised by the IUCN) are considered critically endangered: the Amsterdam albatross, Tristan albatross, and waved albatross. One of the main threats is commercial longline fishing, as the albatrosses and other seabirds—which will readily feed on offal—are attracted to the set bait, become hooked on the lines and drown. An estimated 100,000 albatross per year are killed in this fashion. Unregulated pirate fisheries exacerbate the problem. On Midway Atoll , collisions between Laysan albatrosses and aircraft have resulted in human and bird deaths , as well as severe disruptions in military flight operations . Studies were made in the late 1950s and early 1960s that examined the results of control methods such as the killing of birds, the levelling and clearing of land to eliminate updrafts, and the destruction of annual nesting sites. Tall structures such as traffic control and radio towers killed 3000 birds in flight collisions during 1964–1965 before the towers were taken down. Closure of Naval Air Facility Midway in 1993 eliminated the problem of collisions with military aircraft. Recent reductions in human activity on the island have helped reduce bird deaths, though lead paint pollution near military buildings continues to poison birds by ingestion. Albatross plumes were popular in the early 20th century. In 1909 alone, over 300,000 albatrosses were killed on Midway Island and Laysan Island for their plumes. Another threat to albatrosses is introduced species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack albatrosses or their chicks and eggs. Albatrosses have evolved to breed on islands where land mammals are absent and have not developed defences against them. Even species as small as mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island, the chicks of Tristan albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mice. Introduced species can have other indirect effects; cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island, threatening the Amsterdam albatross; on other islands, introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat.","On Midway Atoll, collisions between Laysan albatrosses and aircraft have resulted in human and bird deaths, as well as severe disruptions in military flight operations.","On Midway Atoll, collisions between Laysan albatrosses and aircraft have resulted in human and bird deaths, as well as severe disruptions in military flight operations.",,
un,"Mossman District Hospital [HEAD] History [SEP] By January 1926 a large, level site off Johnston Road, about 0.5 miles (0.80 km) south-west of the centre of Mossman, had been acquired for the new hospital. A plan of the proposed hospital layout for the site was prepared by Public Works in April 1926, positioning the main building close to the centre of the site, facing east, and accessed from Hospital Street. To the north of the main building, connected via a covered way, were the nurses' quarters, and to south, also connected via a covered way, the maternity ward. At the western side of the site, and not physically connected to the main building, were a number of ancillary buildings, structures and facilities: a doctor's residence (with private driveway off Johnston Road), tennis court, wardsman's quarters, water supply pump house, drying green, laundry and powerhouse, incinerator, and morgue. The buildings were spaced well apart, to allow for future expansion on the site. In April 1926 the Douglas Hospital Committee (established under the Voluntary Hospitals system) was replaced by the Port Douglas Hospitals Board (formed under the 1923 Act). Through 1926 debate between the Board and the Queensland government centred on whether the Port Douglas hospital buildings would be re-located to Mossman, or new construction approved. The Department of Public Works estimated a cost of £20,868 to erect an entirely new hospital and £18,016 if the nurses' quarters and doctor's residence were re-located from Port Douglas. Local estimates were called, which proved lower than Works had anticipated, and in October 1928 the Board accepted from the government a loan of $14,000 for construction of entirely new hospital buildings. However, the Board also referred the Works Department design to Cairns architects Hill and Taylor, to prepare an alternative scheme in concrete based on the original plans. Richard Hill and Arthur John Henry Taylor were in partnership in Cairns from 1927 to c. 1940, with a branch office in Townsville 1933-1939. The partnership was resumed in 1945 but was dissolved in 1952. During the interwar years Hill and Taylor developed an extensive practice in northern Queensland. Their work included the Cairns City Council Chambers (1929-1930, Cairns City Council Chambers); the Johnstone Shire Hall at Innisfail (1935-1938, Johnstone Shire Hall); the Barron Valley Hotel (1940) at Atherton, and buildings at several district hospitals besides Mossman, including Boulia (emergency operating theatre, 1936), Cairns (nurses' quarters, 1937), Mareeba (new hospital building, 1937), and Proserpine (new hospital building 1939-1940, Proserpine Hospital). For the Mossman Hospital, Hill and Taylor proposed replacing the planned timber balustrades to the verandahs with decorative, arcaded concrete verandah facades in the Spanish Mission style popular at the time. They argued that the concrete exterior would be less expensive to maintain, would save on fire insurance costs, and would better withstand cyclonic weather. The Department of Public Works approved the amended design and in mid-1929 extended the loan to £16,000. Spanish Mission style architecture was popularised in Australia from the late 1920s . The emphasis on wide colonnaded or arcaded verandahs and white stuccoed exterior walls set against lush gardens (as popularised in the Californian version of the style), translated well to Australia's warm climate, particularly in Queensland. In utilising this idiom for the Mossman Hospital, Hill and Taylor created the illusion that the buildings were of a more substantial construction than was the reality - being principally timber-framed, clad and lined structures - and the white-walled buildings in the garden setting against a mountain backdrop proved to be extremely picturesque. It is the only Queensland public hospital constructed with a Spanish Mission exterior.",Spanish Mission style architecture was popularised in Australia from the late 1920s.,Spanish Mission style architecture was popularised in Australia from the late 1920s.,,

done,"Banker horse [HEAD] Management and adoption ; Shackleford [SEP] Public Law 105-229, commonly referred to as the Shackleford Banks Wild Horses Protection Act, states that the Bankers on Shackleford Island are to be jointly managed by the National Park Service and another qualified nonprofit entity (currently the Foundation for Shackleford Horses). The herd is limited to 120–130 horses. Population management is achieved through adoption and by administering the contraceptive vaccine Porcine zona pellucida (PZP) to individual mares via dart. The island's horse population is monitored by freeze branding numbers onto each animal's left hindquarter. The identification of individuals allows the National Park Service to ensure correct gender ratios and to select which mares to inject with PZP. Since 2000, adoptions of Bankers from Shackleford have been managed by the Foundation for Shackleford Horses. As of 2007, 56 horses had found new homes, 10 resided with another herd on Cedar Island, and two had been moved to the Ocracoke herd. On November 12, 1996, the Shackleford horses were rounded up by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture's Veterinary Division and tested for equine infectious anemia (EIA). EIA is a potentially lethal disease, a lentivirus transmitted by bodily fluids and insects. Seventy-six of the 184 captured horses tested positive. Those that tested negative were allowed to remain on the island and those with the disease were transported to a temporary quarantine facility. Finding a permanent , isolated area for such a large number of Bankers was a challenging task for the Foundation ; eight days later the state declared all proposed locations for the herd unsuitable . It ordered the euthanization of the 76 infected horses.

Saumarez set a course to intercept, and with the wind in his favour, soon came up on the port side of the two vessels which proved to be the 38-gun French frigate La Réunion and a 14-gun cutter named Espérance, returning from a raiding cruise in the Channel under the command of Captain François A. Dénian. A second British frigate, the 28-gun HMS Circe, was becalmed some 9 nautical miles (17 km) away and Espérance fled towards Cherbourg, leaving Réunion and Crescent to engage alone. Although the French ship was bigger, 951 long tons (966 t) compared to 888 long tons (902 t), and carried a larger crew; the British ship had a slight advantage in weight of shot, 315 pounds (143 kg) to 310 pounds (141 kg) and was marginally faster. After the opening exchanges, Réunion lost her fore yard and mizzen topmast while Crescent lost the top off her foremast. Both ships had rigging cut and a number of sails damaged but Crescent was still able to manoeuvre across Réunion's stern and rake her. This raking caused huge damage to the French ship and her crew, and although Réunion continued to resist for some time, she was no longer able to move effectively. With Saumarez about to cross his bow and Circe now rapidly approaching due to a strengthening wind, Dénian realised he had no choice but to surrender his vessel. The engagement between the French frigate La Réunion and the British frigate Crescent had lasted two hours and ten minutes during which time the cutter , Espérance , managed to escape to Cherbourg .

done,"El Capitan [HEAD] Climbing history ; Free climbing [SEP] As it became clear that any non-crumbling face could be conquered with sufficient perseverance and bolt-hole drilling, some climbers began searching for El Cap routes that could be climbed either free or with minimal aid. The West Face route was free climbed in 1979 by Ray Jardine and Bill Price; but despite numerous efforts by Jardine and others, The Nose resisted free attempts for another fourteen years. The first free ascent of a main El Cap Capitan route , though , was not The Nose , but Salathé Wall . Todd Skinner and Paul Piana made the first free ascent over 9 days in 1988, after 30 days of working the route (graded 5.13b on the Yosemite Decimal System). The Nose was the second major route to be freeclimbed. Two pitches on The Nose blocked efforts to free the route: the ""Great Roof"" graded 5.13c and ""Changing Corners"" graded 5.14a/b. In 1993, Lynn Hill came close to freeing The Nose, making it past the Great Roof and up to Camp VI without falling, stopped only on Changing Corners by a piton jammed in a critical finger hold. After removing the piton she re-climbed the route from the ground. After 4 days of climbing, Hill reached the summit, making her the first person to free climb The Nose. A year later, Hill returned to free climb The Nose in a day, this time reaching the summit in just 23 hours and setting a new standard for free climbing on ""El Cap."" The Nose saw a second free ascent in 1998, when Scott Burke summitted after 261 days of effort. On October 14, 2005, Tommy Caldwell and Beth Rodden, then husband and wife, became the third and fourth people (and the first couple) to free climb The Nose. They took four days on the ascent, swapping leads with each climber free climbing each pitch, either leading or following. Two days later, Caldwell returned to free climb The Nose in less than 12 hours. Caldwell returned two weeks later to free climb El Cap twice in a day, completing The Nose with Rodden, then descending and leading Freerider in a combined time of 23 hours 23 minutes. On January 14, 2015, Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson completed the first free climb of the Dawn Wall after 19 days, one of the hardest climbs in the world. In November 2016, Czech climber Adam Ondra free climbed the Dawn Wall in 8 days.

A total of 23 Gazelles were ordered for Culdrose. Army-owned AH.1s also entered service with 3 Commando Brigade Air Squadron (3 CBAS) of the Royal Marines and later, the Commando Helicopter Force (CHF) of the Fleet Air Arm, where they operated as utility and reconnaissance helicopters in support of the Royal Marines. The 12 Gazelles for 3 CBAS had entered service in 1975, by which time, there were 310 Gazelles on order for the British military. Gazelles that had replaced the Sioux in RAF Sek Kong towards the end of 1974(?) had been found unsuitable for Hong Kong and, by the end of 1978, had been returned to the UK and they were replaced by the Scout AH1. During its Cold War service period, the Army Gazelles flew over 660,000 hours and had over 1,000 modifications made to the aircraft. From the early 1980s, Army-operated Gazelles were fitted with the Gazelle Observation Aid, a gyro-stabilised sight to match their target finding capability with that of the Lynx. The type also had a limited, special operations aviation role with 8 Flight Army Air Corps The type was also frequently used to perform airborne patrols in Northern Ireland. On 17 February 1978, a British Army Gazelle crashed near Jonesborough, County Armagh, after coming under fire from the Provisional IRA during a ground skirmish. During the Falklands War, the Gazelle played a valuable role operating from the flight decks of Royal Navy ships. Under a rapidly performed crash programme specifically for the Falklands conflict, Gazelles were fitted with 68mm SNEB rocket pods and various other optional equipment such as armour plating, flotation gear and folding blade mechanisms. Two Royal Marines Gazelles were shot down on the first day of the landings at San Carlos Water. In a high-profile incident of friendly fire on 6 June 1982, an Army Air Corps Gazelle was mistaken for a low-flying Argentine C-130 Hercules and was shot down by HMS Cardiff', a British Type 42 destroyer. The Gazelle also operated in reconnaissance and liaison roles during the War in Afghanistan. In 2007, it was reported that, while many British helicopters had struggled with the conditions of the Afghan and Iraqi theatres, the Gazelle was the ""best performing model"" with roughly 80% being available for planned operations. Various branches of the British military have operated Gazelles in other theatres, such as during the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq and in the 1999 intervention in Kosovo. In 2009, the Army Air Corps was the sole operator of the Gazelle with approximately 40 in service with a planned out of service date in 2012. In October 2009, it was announced that the out of service date had been extended to support domestic commitments including to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) until 2018 at which point the PSNI was to have their own assets.

Due to the poor water supply within Beijing, the Imperial family and wealthy families would get their water from springs on Mount Yuquan in the northwestern suburbs. Every morning, carts carrying spring water would enter the city through Xizhimen. Thus, a symbol of water was engraved on the barbican gate archway of Xizhimen. Xizhimen, the last gate to remain fully intact, was completely dismantled in 1969. During demolition, workers discovered that parts of the barbican gate's archway were the originals from the 13th century.","Built on the site of the Yuan era gate called Heyimen (和義門), the name was changed in 1419 to reflect its location (""Xizhimen"" means western axis gate).","Built on the site of the Yuan era gate called Heyimen (和義門), Xizhimen's name was changed in 1419 to reflect its location (""Xizhimen"" means western axis gate).",y,

The BLC runs a ""BLC Leads"" program to foster leadership development among member library staff, a reciprocal borrowing agreement through which faculty and other patrons affiliated with any member library can borrow materials for free from other member libraries, a shared virtual catalog and rapid delivery of materials between libraries to fulfill patron requests, cooperative purchasing of scholarly resources, and hosting of communities of interest to foster discussion and collaboration among member libraries. Past activities of the Boston Library Consortium included cooperative collecting and sharing of materials in select subject areas , such as women ' s studies . In 2007, the BLC partnered with the Open Content Alliance (OCA) to digitize BLC member libraries' out-of-copyright print collections and make them freely available online via the Internet Archive. To fund the effort, the BLC pledged more than $845,000 over two years. This partnership made the BLC the first large-scale consortium to embark on a self-funded digitization project with the OCA. In 2014, the BLC, along with the Orbis Cascade Alliance and other groups, pushed back against a publisher price increase on e-books, which they feared would negatively impact academic library budgets. Since 2014, the BLC has administered the Eastern Academic Scholars' Trust (EAST), a collective collections initiative across sixty-five academic libraries throughout the eastern United States. EAST member libraries have committed to retaining over six million volumes. EAST's goal is ""preserving the print scholarly record and ensuring its availability for scholars, students and faculty."" Under BLC auspices, the EAST initiative received startup grants totaling $1.5 million from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the Davis Educational Foundation in 2014–2015.

imp,"List of Dead Like Me characters [HEAD] George's family ; Joy Lass [SEP] Joy Lass (Cynthia Stevenson), born 1961, is George's mother. Described by George as a Virgo and a career legal secretary who enjoys ice skating and John Grisham novels, Joy is organized, neurotic, and a bit foul-mouthed. She hates the word ""moist"" because she thinks it sounds pornographic and is afraid of balloons. George observed that her mother's name is an ironic misnomer, noting, ""Who had the nerve to name you 'Joy'?"" The aftermath of George's death was made worse for Joy by her husband's infidelity and her difficulty communicating with her remaining daughter. She eventually divorces Clancy; the terms of the divorce apparently left Joy with sole ownership and possession of the family residence at 3851 Beatrice Lane (the location of which is revealed in the first-season episode ""Nighthawks""). Joy also confided to George (as Millie) that she does not think she was a very good mother. Unable to afford the childhood home of Georgia and Reggie, Joy began scouting with Reggie for other accommodations—as a result of which she met and began dating Angelo. Her ex - husband , however , had been recently dumped by the woman with whom he cheated and , upon realizing Joy was dating , set out to sabotage his ex - wife ' s romantic plans . Clancy confessed in a later episode he missed her and the life he had with his family. Joy is very disturbed by Reggie's fixation over George's death, and starts to worry about Reggie's sanity. In ""Forget Me Not"", she applied for job placement through Happy Time, where her résumé states that she was a history major at college with a business minor, worked for two law firms, and knows Gregg shorthand and medical shorthand. Five years after George's death, Joy's disposition has made a significant change. Her neurotic nature and strict housekeeping requirements seem to have toned down. She has written a book based on her personal loss and counsels parents of deceased children.","Her ex-husband, however, had been recently dumped by the woman with whom he cheated and, upon realizing Joy was dating, set out to sabotage his ex-wife's romantic plans.","Her ex-husband, however, had been recently dumped by the woman with whom he cheated and, upon realizing Joy was dating, set out to sabotage his ex-wife's romantic plans.",,

un,"2020–2022 world oil market chronology [HEAD] 2021 [SEP] After Saudi Arabia promised further production cuts, WTI reached $51.28 on January 7 and Brent climbed as high as $54.90, the highest since before COVID-19. On January 14, a weaker dollar and an expected COVID-19 relief package helped oil move slightly higher, with WTI at $53.57 and Brent at $56.42, though Europe was experiencing more lockdowns and China had a higher number of COVID-19 cases, both making lower demand likely. WTI finished the first week of February up 8.9 percent to $56.85 and Brent was up 7.8 percent to $59.34, the highest since January 2020 for both. COVID-19 vaccines were a big reason for positive economic news, though analyst Eugen Weinberg of Commerzbank believed optimism was too high. On February 16, WTI closed above $60 for the first time since January 2020, with reasons that included Saudi Arabia production cuts, increased vaccine distribution, and the closing of refineries and production cuts resulting from the 2021 Texas power crisis. The Texas situation resulted in contango for WTI for the first time in seven months, meaning futures with earlier dates had lower prices. On February 23, Brent reached $65.37, the highest since January 2020. After OPEC and others agreed to continue production cuts into April, WTI finished March 4 at $63.83, the highest since April 2019. Brent reached $66.74. Prices were increasing despite high U.S. crude supplies, though the cold weather continued to affect gasoline and distillate. The third week of March ended with the largest loss for a week since October, with COVID-19 increases in Europe a big reason. WTI had fallen as low as $58.94 in a week where it fell 6,4 percent and lost 7.1 percent in one day. Brent finished the week at $64.53, down 6.8 percent for the week one day after falling 6.9 percent, the most in a day since June. Prices recovered March 19 only because of attacks on Yemen. On March 24, after a significant decline the previous day due to COVID-19 lockdowns in Europe, the 2021 Suez Canal obstruction caused prices to recover. The news of the fifth straight week of increases in U.S. crude inventory had little effect. WTI and Brent ended March down nearly 4 percent. With the April 1 announcement that OPEC and other nations would increase production, WTI rose 3.9 percent to close at $61.45 and Brent increased 3.4 percent to $64.86. Oil reached its highest level since March 17 on April 14, with WTI at $63.15 and Brent at $66.58 as U.S. crude inventories fell and OPEC forecast higher demand and more economic growth. Optimism about the end of the pandemic was a factor. Positive economic news in the U . S . contributed to an increase in the price of oil for April , with WTI ending the month at $ 63 . 58 , up 2 . 3 percent for the week and 7 . 5 percent for the month , while Brent finished at $ 67 . 25 , up 1 . 7 percent and 5 . 8 percent . OPEC production increases and continued optimism about the worldwide economy offset news of increases in COVID-19 cases in India. A positive demand forecast for China and the United States, along with lower U.S. crude inventories, led to the highest settlement for WTI since March, at $66.08, and Brent, at $69.32. With continued good economic news in the U.S. as well as lower supplies, WTI had five straight gains ending May 27, with the highest settlement since October 2018, and ended the week and the month up 4.3 percent to $66.32. Brent finished May at $69.63, the highest since March 11, up 4.8 percent for the week and 3.5 percent for the month. The price of gas was $3.03, the highest for Memorial Day since 2014.","Positive economic news in the U.S. contributed to an increase in the price of oil for April, with WTI ending the month at $63.58, up 2.3 percent for the week and 7.5 percent for the month, while Brent finished at $67.25, up 1.7 percent and 5.8 percent.","Positive economic news in the U.S. contributed to an increase in the price of oil for April, with WTI ending the month at $63.58, up 2.3 percent for the week and 7.5 percent for the month, while Brent finished at $67.25, up 1.7 percent and 5.8 percent.",,

done,"Friedrichshafen Hafen station [HEAD] History [SEP] After Friedrichshafen became the first city on Lake Constance to have a railway connection in 1847, the Württemberg Southern Railway was extended by 1849 from the city station to the port to allow the direct transhipment of goods from the boats onto trains, significantly reducing transport costs. In 1850, the first harbour terminal was added to the east pediment of the former salt warehouse (Salzstadel) and customs office. A train ferry service was established to the east of the port station in 1869 to connect with the railway from Romanshorn to Zürich, which was opened in 1855. A new building with a half-timbered facade and bay windows facing the lake was built in place of the first simple station in 1885/86. Upstairs in the new building , Friedrichshafen Hafen station , was a restaurant with a terrace and , until 1909 , a post office . The quarter around the port station was substantially rebuilt from 1929 to 1933. The freight yard was relocated to the northern part of the city and then a new entrance building was built in the International Style to the plans of Karl Hagenmayer of the Reichsbahndirektion Stuttgart (Stuttgart rail division). This building was badly damaged in air raids in 1944, but was rebuilt after the Second World War in its original form. After Friedrichshafen had increasingly lost its importance as a railway location after the Second World War, the rail ferry service to Romanshorn was closed in 1976. The track and ancillary equipment lying to the east of the entrance building that had served the ferry has been removed in the subsequent years. The station building has retained its function and was sold to the city in 1988. After a new terminal building for the railway, customs and ferry operations was built on the ferry plaza, the former station building was rebuilt from 1993 to 1996 as the Zeppelin Museum. The track layout has been considerably simplified since the mid-1970s. In addition to changes to the layout of the entrance building and the station's track layout, there have been repeated changes over the years to the adjacent port. Today numerous other ports on Lake Constance can be reached by ferry and the car ferry to Romanshorn.","Upstairs in the new building was a restaurant with a terrace and, until 1909, a post office.","Upstairs in the new building, Friedrichshafen Hafen station, was a restaurant with a terrace and, until 1909, a post office.",t,hafen' replaced from title

un,"Loch Katrine [HEAD] History [SEP] Robert Roy MacGregor was born at the head of the loch. Loch Katrine is now owned by Scottish Water, and has been the primary water reservoir for much of the city of Glasgow and its surrounding areas since 1859. The water level has been artificially raised by around 1.8 metres (5.9 ft) - the loch can be drawn down by a maximum of 2 metres (6.6 ft). The water drawn down provides gravitational flow, using the Katrine aqueduct, to the Milngavie water treatment works via two 41 kilometres (25 mi) long aqueducts and 21 kilometres (13 mi) of tunnel. Milngavie itself is situated at almost 122 metres ( 400 ft ) above sea level - sufficient to provide adequate water pressure to the majority of the city without the need for pumping . The system can deliver up to 230,000,000 litres (51,000,000 imp gal) a day. Construction was started in 1855 and the works was opened by Queen Victoria in 1859. The aqueduct project was built under the guidance of the eminent civil engineer John Frederick Bateman (1810–1889), an example of his engineering prowess that can still be seen working today. The second aqueduct was opened in 1901. Water levels are supplemented via a dam and short tunnel from Loch Arklet, a reservoir located between Loch Katrine itself and Loch Lomond, beside the road to Inversnaid; this project was completed in 1914. A longer tunnel beneath Ben A'an which brings water from the Glen Finglas Reservoir was completed in 1958, with the dam being completed in 1965. Oil-fired vessels are not permitted to sail its waters due to the danger of pollution to the drinking water of Glasgow. The steamboat SS Sir Walter Scott has provided sailings on the loch since 1900. It was coal-fired until 2007, when it was converted to use bio-diesel fuel, and continues to provide local tourist transport between Trossachs Pier and Stronachlachar during the summer.",Milngavie itself is situated at almost 122 metres (400 ft) above sea level - sufficient to provide adequate water pressure to the majority of the city without the need for pumping.,Milngavie itself is situated at almost 122 metres (400 ft) above sea level - sufficient to provide adequate water pressure to the majority of the city without the need for pumping.,,

un,"Merowe Dam [HEAD] Archaeology [SEP] The fertile Nile valley has been attracting human settlement for thousands of years. The section between the 4th and 5th cataract—a significant portion of which will be inundated by the reservoir lake—has been densely populated through nearly all periods of (pre)history, but very little archaeological work has ever been conducted in this particular region. Recent surveys have confirmed the richness and diversity of traceable remains, from the Stone Age to the Islamic period. Several foreign institutions have been recently or are currently involved in salvage archaeology in the region under the umbrella Merowe Dam Archaeological Salvage Project (MDASP). Among them are , , , Humboldt University of Berlin, the , the , the , the , - consortium, and the . Their main problems are the shortness of the remaining time and limited funding. Unlike the large UNESCO campaign conducted in Egypt before the completion of the Aswan High Dam, when more than a thousand archaeological sites could be documented and complete buildings were moved to prevent them from drowning in Lake Nasser's floods, work at the 4th cataract is much more restricted. Since 2006, the archaeologists working for the Merowe Dam Archaeological Salvage Project became accused by environmental and human rights activists as well as the representatives of the affected people of facilitating the political legitimatization of the project. The archaeologists working for the dam project found themselves in an ethical dilemma since they were undertaking salvage excavations while the local people were in opposition to the building of the dam that necessitates both their resettlement and the archaeological campaign. Historian Runoko Rashidi issued a statement in solidarity with Sudanese Nubians protesting the dams and called for a halt to their construction. We have never forgotten the terrible tragedy resulting from the Aswan High Dam in Egyptian Nubia.

un,"Tardive dyskinesia [HEAD] Epidemiology [SEP] Tardive dyskinesia most commonly occurs in people with psychiatric conditions who are treated with antipsychotic medications for many years. The average rate of people affected has been estimated to be around 30% for individuals taking antipsychotic medication, such as that used to treat schizophrenia. A study being conducted at the Yale University School of Medicine has estimated that ""32% of people develop persistent tics after 5 years on major tranquilizers, 57% by 15 years, and 68% by 25 years."" More drastic data was found during a longitudinal study conducted on individuals 45 years of age and older who were taking antipsychotic drugs. According to this research study, 26% of people developed tardive dyskinesia after just one year on the medication. Another 60% of this at-risk group developed the disorder after 3 years, and 23% developed severe cases of tardive dyskinesia within 3 years. According to these estimates, the majority of people will eventually develop the disorder if they remain on the drugs long enough. Elderly people are more prone to develop tardive dyskinesia, and elderly women are more at-risk than elderly men. The risk is much lower for younger men and women, and also more equal across the sexes. People who have undergone electroconvulsive therapy or have a history of diabetes or heavy alcohol use also have a higher risk of developing tardive dyskinesia. Several studies have recently been conducted comparing the number of people affected of tardive dyskinesia with second generation, or more modern, antipsychotic drugs to that of first generation drugs. The newer antipsychotics appear to have a substantially reduced potential for causing tardive dyskinesia . However, some studies express concern that the number of people affected has decreased far less than expected, cautioning against the overestimation of the safety of modern antipsychotics. A physician can evaluate and diagnose a person with tardive dyskinesia by conducting a systematic examination. The physician should ask the person to relax, and look for symptoms like facial grimacing, eye or lip movements, tics, respiratory irregularities, and tongue movements. In some cases, people experience nutritional problems, so a physician can also look for a gain or loss in weight. Apart from the underlying psychiatric disorder, tardive dyskinesia may cause afflicted people to become socially isolated. It also increases the risk of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and can even lead to suicide. Emotional or physical stress can increase the severity of dyskinetic movements, whereas relaxation and sedation have the opposite effect.",The newer antipsychotics appear to have a substantially reduced potential for causing tardive dyskinesia.,The newer antipsychotics appear to have a substantially reduced potential for causing tardive dyskinesia.,,

After Griffin wrote the screenplay, Soderbergh signed on to direct. The film opened to critical acclaim and widespread commercial success. It quickly became Soderbergh's highest-grossing movie to date, grossing more than $183 million domestically and more than $450 million worldwide. Rolling Stone credited the movie with ""[spawning] a new era of heist movies"". In the same year, Soderbergh made Full Frontal, which was shot mostly on digital video in an improvisational style that deliberately blurred the line between which actors were playing characters and which were playing fictionalized versions of themselves. A year later, he was asked by executives at Warner Bros Studios to direct the psychological thriller Insomnia (2002), starring Academy Award winners Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank. Despite their insistence, Soderbergh wanted to use the film as a transitory project for up-and-coming director Christopher Nolan. Before returning to the Ocean's series, Soderbergh directed K Street (2003), a ten-part political HBO series he co-produced with George Clooney. The series was both partially improvised and each episode being produced in the five days prior to airing to take advantage of topical events that could be worked into the fictional narrative. Actual political players appeared as themselves, either in cameos or portraying fictionalized versions of themselves, notably James Carville and Mary Matalin.

A loss at Dundee was overturned by League officials and the game awarded to East Kilbride after the Whalers were found guilty of fielding ineligible players. The 6 wins also included an awarded victory over Denny Broncos and an unfulfilled fixture at Granite City was declared a tie. Despite falling at the first hurdle in the playoffs, this was a highly successful year considering the small squad used. An unprecedented number of injuries compounded the problem, but with many players playing both ways, a difficult year was completed with some success. Following this relative success, a number of veteran players announced their retirement. Their places were filled by no fewer than 6 of the Junior squad who moved up to join the Seniors, in addition to the new players recruited from Rookie Trials. This left a very inexperienced squad, and despite the late addition of a number of players from the Clydesdale Colts, who were ""taking a year out"" (but never returned) during 1996, a disappointing Season followed.

un,"Crimes against humanity [HEAD] Term origins ; First use [SEP] The Republican Platform for the 1860 election for President of the United States used the phrase in its ninth article: 9. That we brand the recent reopening of the African slave trade, under the cover of our national flag, aided by perversions of judicial power, as a crime against humanity and a burning shame to our country and age; and we call upon Congress to take prompt and efficient measures for the total and final suppression of that execrable traffic. The term "" crimes against humanity "" was used by George Washington Williams , an American minister , politician and historian , in a letter he wrote to the United States Secretary of State describing the atrocities committed by Leopold II of Belgium ' s administration in the Congo Free State in 1890 . This was an early but not, as is often claimed, the first use of the term in its modern sense in the English language. In his first annual message in December 1889, U.S. President Harrison spoke about the slave trade in Africa as a “crime against humanity"". Already in 1883, George Washington Williams used the same term in his reflections about slavery in the United States. In treaty law, the term originated in the Second Hague Convention of 1899 preamble and was expanded in the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907 preamble and their respective regulations, which were concerned with the codification of new rules of international humanitarian law. The preamble of the two Conventions referenced the ""laws of humanity"" as an expression of underlying inarticulated humanistic values. The term is part of what is known as the Martens Clause. On May 24, 1915, the Allied Powers, Britain, France, and Russia, jointly issued a statement explicitly and for the first time ever charging another government of committing ""a crime against humanity"". An excerpt from this joint statement reads: In view of these new crimes of Ottoman Empire against humanity and civilization, the Allied Governments announce publicly to the Sublime Porte that they will hold personally responsible for these crimes all members of the Ottoman Government, as well as those of their agents who are implicated in such massacres. At the conclusion of the war, an international war crimes commission recommended the creation of a tribunal to try ""violations of the laws of humanity"". However, the US representative objected to references to ""law of humanity"" as being imprecise and insufficiently developed at that time and the concept was not pursued.","The term ""crimes against humanity"" was used by George Washington Williams, an American minister, politician and historian, in a letter he wrote to the United States Secretary of State describing the atrocities committed by Leopold II of Belgium's administration in the Congo Free State in 1890.","The term ""crimes against humanity"" was used by George Washington Williams, an American minister, politician and historian, in a letter he wrote to the United States Secretary of State describing the atrocities committed by Leopold II of Belgium's administration in the Congo Free State in 1890.",,

imp,"Cataract (beam engine) [HEAD] Open loop control ; Centrifugal governor [SEP] Although the centrifugal governor was already known from its use for water- and windmills, it was not until 1788 when Watt was the first to apply it to a steam engine. This was the 'Lap Engine', an early rotative engine now preserved in the Science Museum, London. With a rotative engine, it was necessary to control the rate at which an engine moved throughout its stroke, not merely to vary the timing between strokes. This required the use of a throttle valve in the steam supply , controlled by the governor . As the load on mill engines and similar uses could vary, closed-loop control such as the engine speed-based centrifugal governor was also needed. The cataract was thus not used on rotative engines, not even where single-acting Cornish winding engines were still used in Cornwall. Cornish engines were not amenable to control by a throttle valve, as their operating cycle depended on the condensation time more than a throttled steam supply. Non-rotative beam engines also had no easy means to drive a centrifugal governor. For these reasons the cataract remained in service for as long as the Cornish engine did.","This required the use of a throttle valve in the steam supply, controlled by the governor.","This required the use of a throttle valve in the steam supply, controlled by the governor.",,

Out of 24 games played Great Britain won 22, drew one and lost one – making them the most successful British tourists so far. The 1970 Lions contained a galaxy of stars including captain Frank Myler, Roger Millward, Cliff Watson and Mal Reilly. Future Kangaroo Tour captain and later coach Bob Fulton made his test debut in the 1970 Ashes series (Fulton had actually played 3 games for Australia in the 1968 World Cup but at the time tests and World Cup games were classed differently). Harry Bath again coached Australia to victory in the 1970 World Cup Final in a brutal game that became known as the ""Battle of Headingley"". Bath also coached the team on a tour of New Zealand in 1971. On that tour Geoff Starling became the youngest player to ever represent Australia. He was 18 years and 181 days old when playing a tour match against a New Zealand XIII at Huntly. Australia lost the 1972 World Cup Final to Great Britain in controversial circumstances. Australian captain Graeme Langlands was denied what seemed a fair try by being ruled offside by the French referee after catching a kick put up by halfback Dennis Ward. Television footage of the 1972 World Cup Final try showed Graeme Langlands was approximately a metre behind Ward when he kicked the ball . The French referee Georges Jameau's alleged reason for not awarding the try was that he did not believe anyone could have scored it from an onside position. The World Cup final was tied at 10–10 after full-time and was still locked after extra time. Great Britain were awarded the victory due to a higher points table placing after the pool rounds of the competition. The Final was also highlighted by an 80-metre try to Lions captain, winger Clive Sullivan. On the 1978 Kangaroo tour, Great Britain defeated Australia in the second test at Bradford, 18–14, before a crowd of 26,447. It took ten years, and fifteen consecutive test defeats before Britain could defeat the Kangaroos again, starting with Australia's 3–0 whitewash of the Lions during their 1979 Australasian tour. The Kangaroos had already won the first test 15–9 at Wigan and wrapped up the series with a 23–6 win in the third test at Headingley. However, the Australians were surprisingly defeated by the French team in both tests played at the end of the 1978 tour.

When Frank Warren was 9, the family moved to Portland. When he was 15 he worked for Wells Fargo; he also worked for Ladd & Tilton Bank. In 1866, Warren was a member of The Pioneer Base Ball Club. Warren founded the Warren Packing Company, a salmon canning business, and was considered a pioneer of the salmon canning industry on the Columbia River, building his first cannery at Cathlamet, Washington, in 1869. He later built a cannery in Warrendale, which was also the site of a state-run fish hatchery in 1889 and 1890. Warren married Anna Sophia Atkinson, the daughter of pioneer missionary George H. Atkinson, in 1872. They had four children, Frank, Frances, George, and Anna. The Warrens were members of the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Portland. In the 1890s the Warrens were active members of the church First Congregational United Church of Christ in Portland and their patronage helped acquire the land and complete the church building next to the South Park Blocks .

un,"Let Toys Be Toys [HEAD] Other campaigns inspired by Let Toys Be Toys ; Let Clothes Be Clothes [SEP] Let Clothes Be Clothes launched in 2014 as an allied but separate campaign to Let Toys Be Toys, focused on challenging gender stereotyping in the design and marketing of childrenswear, footwear and accessories on the UK high street. The campaign is led by writer and activist Francesca Cambridge Mallen, a former indie business owner who in 2013 started making childrenswear from home after becoming concerned at the lack of STEM themed clothing marketed to girls. Inspired by Craftivist Sarah Corbett, Mallen taught herself to make simple space themed dresses, dinosaur skirts and unicorn trousers, selling under the name Sewing Circus until she sold the business in 2018. In 2015 the campaign challenged a range of science themed t-shirts produced in collaboration between Marks and Spencer and the Natural History Museum in London, which were marketed to boys only. In March 2015 a demonstration led by Let Clothes Be Clothes took place outside the Natural History Museum where staff were handed a petition of over 5000 names, demanding that the range be marketed to both boys and girls. The demonstration was supported by Labour MP Chi Onwurah who went on twitter to encourage others to turn out and support the action stating ""girls want a share in science too"" as well as her Labour colleague Tessa Jowell ""Come on M&S/NHM. The clocks changed but it’s still 2015. Can’t believe I have to say this: girls enjoy science too!” John Lewis became the first major retailer to remove girls and boys labels from its clothing range . Some declared the move an act of political correctness, including Piers Morgan who tweeted ""Britain has officially gone bonkers"" over a photograph of the newspaper article. The move was heavily praised by parents and commentators, outweighing more conservative views such as Tory Councillor Luke Stubbs, who threatened to burn his John Lewis Loyalty Card in protest. Writing for the New Statesman, Victoria Smith poked fun at such attitudes stating that perhaps a content warning was needed ""whenever there's a risk they might come into contact with a toddler of ambiguous gender presentation?"" while at the New Scientist, Lara Williams wrote ""If sex and gender aren't a perfect dichotomy - why should clothing be?""",John Lewis became the first major retailer to remove girls and boys labels from its clothing range.,John Lewis became the first major retailer to remove girls and boys labels from its clothing range.,,
imp,"Ronnie Biggs [HEAD] Escape and abscondment ; Rio de Janeiro [SEP] In 1970, when Biggs arrived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil did not have an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom. In 1971, Biggs's eldest son, Nicholas, aged 10, died in a car crash in Melbourne. In 1974, Daily Express reporter Colin MacKenzie received information suggesting that Biggs was in Rio de Janeiro; a team consisting of MacKenzie, photographer Bill Lovelace and reporter Michael O'Flaherty confirmed this and broke the story. Scotland Yard detective Jack Slipper arrived soon afterwards, but Biggs could not be extradited because his girlfriend, nightclub dancer Raimunda de Castro, was pregnant. Brazilian law at the time did not allow a parent of a Brazilian child to be extradited. During 1974, in Rio, Biggs, an avid jazz fan, collaborated with Bruce Henri (an American double bass player), Jaime Shields, and Aureo de Souza to record Mailbag Blues, a musical narrative of his life that he intended to use as a movie soundtrack. This album was left undiscovered until it was finally released in 2004 by whatmusic.com. In April 1977 Biggs attended an informal drinks party on board the Royal Navy frigate HMS Danae (F47), which was in Rio for a courtesy visit, but he was not arrested. Though in Brazil he was safe from extradition, Biggs's status as a known criminal meant he could not work, visit bars or be away from home after 10:00 p.m. To provide an income, Biggs's family hosted barbecues at his home in Rio, where tourists could meet Biggs and hear him recount his involvement in the robbery, which, in fact, was minor. Biggs was even visited by former footballer Stanley Matthews, whom Biggs afterwards invited to his apartment after hearing that he was in Rio. ""We had tea on the small balcony at the rear of his home, and one of the first things he asked was, 'How are Charlton Athletic doing?' It turned out he had supported Charlton from being a small boy and had often seen me play at The Valley.""

imp,"The Haters [HEAD] The Audience [SEP] Many of The Haters later performances involved whole audiences being led by inside agitators to actually ruin or destroy entire venues. Proprietors were not always informed of the choreography in advance . These were what The Haters called celebrations of entropy. The audience that was as much a part of the actual performance as the performers were. Without any conditioning beforehand, entire audiences would halt their mayhem the very instant the soundtrack stopped. It made no difference if the attendance was 20 or 200. When the sound stopped, so did the action. There is also an obvious subsequent utilization of having the extremities of the soundtrack utilized as the movement of a stage curtain. That is, that one can predetermine the length of a performance by choosing the length of the tape for the recording. At first The Haters did not care what the sound on the tape was as long as it was constant. Otherwise they had no other interest in sound on their stage for years. This did not mean they were not interested in sounds at all. In fact, whenever The Haters were in the studio, they'd always give great detail to every aspect of the sound. A record or CD release, and a live performance are two different things; and they absolutely never saw any reason whatsoever why one had to sound anything like the other. There were a few exceptions, namely, some conceptual ""anti-records"" they released in the late 1980s and early 90s. The first, from 1988, was entitled Wind Licked Dirt, and consisted of an uncut vinyl LP in a cover packed with a bunch of small pebbles, which are included to ""play"" the record with. A later edition of this was made with a ""CD"" (a clear protective disc from a spindle of blank discs), and it is currently available as a ""C-0 cassette."" The second was entitled Oxygen is Flammable, and was a broken piece of plastic packaged in a small box. Enclosed were instructions which state that the piece of plastic is a record, and that it's played by pouring water over it. The instructions also call attention to possible similarities between the sounds of water falling and fire rising. The third, Shear, was a ball of cotton batting packaged in a small box. Wrapped around the contents are instructions on three thin strips of paper, which informs the holder that the cotton batting is a recording, which is played by squeezing. The sounds this ""record"" gives are described by Larsen as being a ""sharp fluffy slightness"" and a ""thin fluffy pressed"". These three releases are, in and of themselves, a kind of performance piece.

un,"Tablet press [HEAD] [SEP] A tablet press is a mechanical device that compresses powder into tablets of uniform size and weight. A tablet press can be used to manufacture tablets of a wide variety of materials, including pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, cleaning products, industrial pellets and cosmetics. To form a tablet, the granulated powder material must be metered into a cavity formed by two punches and a die, and then the punches must be pressed together with great force to fuse the material together. A tablet is formed by the combined pressing action of two punches and a die. In the first step of a typical operation, the bottom punch is lowered in the die creating a cavity into which the granulated feedstock is fed. The exact depth of the lower punch can be precisely controlled to meter the amount of powder that fills the cavity. The excess is scraped from the top of the die, and the lower punch is drawn down and temporarily covered to prevent spillage. Then, the upper punch is brought down into contact with the powder as the cover is removed. The force of compression is delivered by high pressure compression rolls which fuse the granulated material together into a hard tablet. After compression, the lower punch is raised to eject the tablet. Tablet tooling design is critical to ensuring a robust tablet compression process. Considerations when designing pharmaceutical tablet compression tool design include tooling set, head flat, top head angle, top head radius, head back angle, and punch shank. As well as ensuring a single dose of drug, the tablet tooling is also critical in ensuring the size, shape, embossing and other physical characteristics of the tablet that are required for identification. There are 2 types of tablet presses: single-punch and rotary tablet presses. Most high-speed tablet presses take the form of a rotating turret that holds any number of punches. As they rotate around the turret, the punches come into contact with cams which control the punch's vertical position. Punches and dies are usually custom made for each application, and can be made in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and can be customized with manufacturer codes and scoring lines to make tablets easier to break. Depending on tablet size , shape , material , and press configuration , a typical modern press can produce from 250 , 000 to over 1 , 700 , 000 tablets an hour .

In the face of steadily mounting pressure from Germany and Italy, by March 1941 Yugoslavia had been completely surrounded by members of the Axis. In this situation, some senior government figures were advocating for Yugoslavia to also join the Tripartite Pact. After a number of delays , Prince Paul and Prime Minister Cvetković signed the Pact on 25 March , but the following day there were demonstrations in Belgrade , with protesters chanting "" Better the grave than a slave , better a war than the pact "" . In the early hours of 27 March a bloodless military coup d'état was executed. In the wake of the coup, the new government refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact, but did not openly rule it out. The coup found little support with the Croatian population, and on the day after the invasion commenced Maček resigned from the government and returned to Zagreb in anticipation of unrest.","After a number of delays, Prince Paul and Prime Minister Cvetković signed the Pact on 25 March, but the following day there were demonstrations in Belgrade, with protesters chanting ""Better the grave than a slave, better a war than the pact"".","After a number of delays, Prince Paul and Prime Minister Cvetković signed the Pact on 25 March, but the following day there were demonstrations in Belgrade, with protesters chanting ""Better the grave than a slave, better a war than the pact"".",,

It has a maximum elevation of 1,256 metres (4,121 ft) and an area of about 600 square kilometres (230 sq mi). It is composed of three mountain ranges (from west to east): Lesser Luberon (Petit Luberon), Greater Luberon (Grand Luberon) and Eastern Luberon (Luberon oriental). The valleys north and south of them contain a number of towns and villages as well as agricultural land; the northern part is marked by the Calavon, while the southern part is characterised by the Durance. The Luberon is often advertised under the name Lubéron (with an acute accent on top of the ""e""); some dictionaries justify that the two spellings are interchangeable. The total number of inhabitants varies greatly between winter and summer, due to a massive influx of tourists during the warm season. It is a favourite destination for French high society and British and American visitors because of the pleasant and picturesque towns and villages, comfortable way of life, agricultural wealth, historical and cultural associations, as well as hiking trails. Samuel Beckett notably lived in Cave Bonelly , a vineyard near to Roussillon , during World War II . In the 1970s, people came from all over France to the Luberon in search of a communitarian ideal. In the last two decades the Luberon has become known in the English-speaking world especially through a series of books by British author Peter Mayle chronicling his life as an expatriate settled in the Luberon village of Ménerbes. These are titled A Year in Provence, Toujours Provence and Encore Provence. Another of Mayle's books, a novel set in the Luberon, was made into a film called A Good Year (2006) directed by Ridley Scott, starring Russell Crowe and filmed in the region.","Samuel Beckett notably lived in Cave Bonelly, a vineyard near to Roussillon, during World War II.","Samuel Beckett notably lived in Cave Bonelly, a vineyard near to Roussillon, during World War II.",y,no actual change

done,"Supreme Court of Sweden [HEAD] History [SEP] Historically, all judicial power was vested in the Monarch, but in 1614 Gustavus Adolphus instituted Svea Hovrätt and authorized it to issue sentences in his name. Those not satisfied with sentencing were able to turn directly to the monarch, and appeals were handled by the Justice Department of the Privy Council (in Swedish: Justitierevisionen), a committee of that council. Under the rule of King Gustav III, the noble Privy Council was suspended in 1789 after the Riksdag of the estates introduced an addition to the instrument of government from 1772 called the Union and Security Act. After the Riksdag ended the King on May 19 instituted the King's Supreme Court (Swedish: Konungens högsta domstol) to handle legal matters. There were twelve judges of the court, half of which was to be nobles and half commoners. While in session, no more than eight judges could serve at the same time, and with equal numbers of nobles and commoners. In the court the king held two votes, as well as the deciding vote in case of a tie. However, this voting right was never exercised, except on the centennial of the court, when King Oscar II took part in the decision of one case. Under the 1809 Instrument of Government, the judges of the Supreme Court became salaried civil servants, with the title of Councillor of Justice (justitieråd). The earlier Lord High Steward or Justiciar (Riksdrots) became the new Minister of State for Justice (or Prime Minister for Justice) and the foremost member of the court in 1809, but when the modern government ministries were created in 1840, this minister of justice were separated from the court. In 1844 the requirement on equal numbers of noblemen and commoners in service as judges of the court was dropped. In 1909 the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsrätten) and the Council on Legislation (Lagrådet) were created to assume certain tasks that had been handled by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Administrative Court assumed responsibility for ruling on administrative cases and the Legal Council received the responsibility for judicial review (strictly speaking legal preview). At the same time the monarch lost voting power in the court. The right to appeal cases to the Supreme Court was limited for the first time in 1915. A special dispensation was required before trying a minor civil or criminal case. Dispensation was to be given when there was a ruling that could become a precedent , and in 1945 this requirement was extended to all cases in the Supreme Court of Sweden . In 1948, the legal procedure was supplemented with oral proceedings and to satisfy the need for additional space the Supreme Court was moved in 1949 from the Royal Palace to the Bonde Palace on Stadsholmen. By the Instrument of Government of 1974 the Supreme Court discontinued the practice to award sentencing in the name of the Swedish monarch (Kungl Maj:t), as well as announcing them at the Royal Palace where they were adorned with the royal seal.","Dispensation was to be given when there was a ruling that could become a precedent, and in 1945 this requirement was extended to all cases.","Dispensation was to be given when there was a ruling that could become a precedent, and in 1945 this requirement was extended to all cases in the Supreme Court of Sweden.",t,"replacement from title, but 'supreme court' and 'sweden' mentioned throughout"

The shooting left Flynt partially paralyzed with permanent spinal cord damage, and in need of a wheelchair. Flynt's injuries caused him constant, excruciating pain, and he was addicted to painkillers until multiple surgeries deadened the affected nerves. He also suffered a stroke caused by one of several drug overdoses on his analgesic medication. He recovered, but had pronunciation difficulties thereafter. Flynt's attorney was very seriously wounded. Franklin, a militant white supremacist and serial killer, also shot Vernon Jordan; he targeted other Black and Jewish people in a killing spree from 1977–1980. Violently opposed to 'miscegenation,' he confessed to the shootings many years later, claiming he was outraged by an interracial photo shoot in Hustler. About Flynt and a Hustler pictorial, he stated, ""I saw that interracial couple ... having sex ... It just made me sick ... I threw the magazine down and thought, I'm gonna kill that guy."" Flynt himself suspected the attack was part of a larger conspiracy involving ultra-right elements surrounding Congressman Larry McDonald also behind the Karen Silkwood case with ties to the Intelligence Community and that Franklin may have been subject to MKULTRA-style Mind Control. Franklin was never brought to trial for the attack on Flynt. Franklin was eventually charged in Missouri with eight unrelated counts of murder and sentenced to death.

un,"Washington State University College of Nursing [HEAD] History [SEP] The Spokane League for Nursing and the Inland Empire Nurses' Association formed a joint committee on nursing education in 1964 with the goal of establishing a baccalaureate nursing program in Eastern Washington. Following several years of meetings and consultations, a steering committee proposed an intercollegiate model of nursing education to the presidents and boards of regents of the four colleges and universities interested in the concept: Washington State University in Pullman; Eastern Washington State College in Cheney; and Whitworth College and Fort Wright College, both in Spokane. All four institutions approved the plan, which had students completing pre-nursing studies at their respective colleges then moving on to nursing studies at the Intercollegiate Center for Nursing Education in Spokane. The first class of 37 students was admitted to ICNE in July, 1969. The program was accredited by the National League for Nursing in 1974. ICNE was located in the former Carnegie Library in downtown Spokane when it opened. That space proved inadequate to the program's growth, and Sen. Warren Magnuson, D-Wash., helped obtain federal financing in 1977 to build a new facility to house the nursing program. The Warren G . Magnuson Intercollegiate Nursing Building opened in 1980 on a site across from Spokane Falls Community College , northwest of downtown Spokane . The facility cost $5.76 million. In 1981, ICNE established ICNE Yakima as an extended campus, housed in a small cottage near Yakima Valley Community College. The next year, Fort Wright College closed, ending its participation in the intercollegiate nursing education program. Washington State University opened branch campuses in Vancouver, Washington, and in Richland, Washington, which is part of the Tri-Cities. Nursing programs were offered at both branch campuses. In 2005, the Washington Legislature gave WSU $32 million to build a College of Nursing facility on what was then called the Riverpoint Campus - Now WSU Health Sciences Spokane - in downtown Spokane. The final construction cost was $34.6 million, with the federal government contributing another nearly $2.5 million to fund technology for distance education and simulation.

done,"Kimsooja [HEAD] Early career [SEP] Kimsooja was born in Daegu, South Korea, in 1957. She studied Western painting at the Hongik University in Seoul and her origin as a painter was a crucial starting point for the development of her art. While in University, she discovered her love for understanding the connection of aesthetics and human psychology which lead to the motive behind many of her works. Kimsooja references, from her first work to her most recent, how humans react to fabric, paint, sculpture and more, and how we experience the world as humans. Kimsooja's ""Sewing"" series (1983–1992), her first work with fabric, brought forth an assemblage of fabric forming cruciform structures that synthesized an entangled and knotted vision of the world into a system of horizontals and verticals. Like the Spatialist painter Lucio Fontana, who pierced the uni-colored canvas with a sharped-edged dagger, Kimsooja also made art that was no longer a screen of illusion but a three-dimensional structure as she weaved through the surface of the work, piercing holes into it. These early sewn works, in turn, were inspired by the fabric and clothes that her grandmother had owned, while also fueled by Kimmsoja's own interest in the traditional association between female labour and needlework in Korean culture. Subsequent to a residency at MoMA PS1 in 1992–93, Kimsooja initiated a series of site-specific installations that found their origin in the Korean color spectrum (obangsaek). She Kimsooja created sculptures inspired from Korean bedcover cloth bundles that are associated in Korean culture with travel and migration , and may also be interpreted in her work as an allusion to restrictions on female activities . These bedcover bundles inspired the title of a number of sculptures and installation works that Kimsooja titled after the Korean word, bottari, that intimates the idea of travel but also refers to concepts of wrapping and unfolding. In 1992, the installation , shown at MoMA PS1, took up an entire brick wall where small torn pieces of used Korean bedcover fabric were inserted by the artist in tiny holes between the bricks. The sculptural elements alongside the wall installation were composed of everyday objects wrapped in Bottari cloth, such as a carrier, a doorframe, a hook, a saw, a spool, a shovel, a clothing rack, or a ladder. While any kind of fabric can be used to make bottari, Kimsooja favours second-hand clothes to allude to the passage of time and the objects’ previous life before they were transformed into works of art. The bottari and the act of travel continue to be central themes for her work (1999), made on the road as a truck heaped with piles of clothing, wrapped in silk bedcovers, travelled from one location to another. Kimsooja dedicated the piece, which was presented at the Venice Biennale, to refugees of the Kosovo war.","She created sculptures inspired from Korean bedcover cloth bundles that are associated in Korean culture with travel and migration, and may also be interpreted in her work as an allusion to restrictions on female activities.","Kimsooja created sculptures inspired from Korean bedcover cloth bundles that are associated in Korean culture with travel and migration, and may also be interpreted in her work as an allusion to restrictions on female activities.",y,

done,"Simone dei Crocifissi [HEAD] Life [SEP] Simone dei Crocifissi was born in Bologna. He was son of the shoemaker Filippo di Benvenuto. In the 17th century he was renamed ""of the Crucifixes"" (dei Crocifissi) for his ""ability to paint great images of the Redeemer, for our sake nailed to the cross"" (Malvasia). He trained with Franco Bolognese. He was active as a painter at Bologna from 1354 to 1399 in the wake of Vitale da Bologna's previous experience, which he engaged in a robustly more popular style of painting. The initial artistic phase of Simone Di Fillipo can be seen via the frescoes of the life of Christ that come from the church of Santa Maria di Mezzaratta (mid-1350s century), now preserved in the National Art Gallery of Bologna (Pinacoteca di Bologna), where the interest for Giotto's space and plastic solutions is interpreted with a sharp expressivity. The influence on Simone of Vitale ' s painting style can be caught in works such as the polyptych 474 , also preserved at the Pinacoteca di Bologna . On the other hand, works like the Pietà by (1368), and the Crucifix of St. James (1370), on display in the same museum, highlight the influence of Jacopo Avanzi and his solemn style, even if re-interpreted stressing the devotional goal, as in the Madonna by Giovanni da Piacenza (1382).

done,"Mercury poisoning [HEAD] Causes ; Sources ; Methylmercury and related organomercury compounds [SEP] Methylmercury is the major source of organic mercury for all individuals. Due to bioaccumulation it works its way up through the food web and thus biomagnifies, resulting in high concentrations among populations of some species. Top predatory fish, such as tuna or swordfish, are usually of greater concern than smaller species. The US FDA and the EPA advise women of child-bearing age, nursing mothers, and young children to completely avoid swordfish, shark, king mackerel and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, and to limit consumption of albacore (""white"") tuna to no more than 170 g (6 oz) per week, and of all other fish and shellfish to no more than 340 g (12 oz) per week. A 2006 review of the risks and benefits of fish consumption found, for adults, the benefits of one to two servings of fish per week outweigh the risks, even (except for a few fish species) for women of childbearing age, and that avoidance of fish consumption could result in significant excess coronary heart disease deaths and suboptimal neural development in children. Because the process of mercury-dependent sequestration of selenium is slow, the period between exposure to methylmercury and the appearance of symptoms in adult poisoning cases tends to be extended. The longest recorded latent period is five months after a single exposure, in the Dartmouth case (see History); other latent periods in the range of weeks to months have also been reported. When the first symptom appears, typically paresthesia (a tingling or numbness in the skin), it is followed rapidly by more severe effects, sometimes ending in coma and death. The toxic damage appears to be determined by the peak value of mercury, not the length of the exposure. Methylmercury exposure during rodent gestation, a developmental period that approximately models human neural development during the first two trimesters of gestation, has long-lasting behavioral consequences that appear in adulthood and, in some cases, may not appear until aging. Prefrontal cortex or dopamine neurotransmission could be especially sensitive to even subtle gestational methylmercury exposure and suggests that public health assessments of methylmercury based on intellectual performance may underestimate the impact of methylmercury in public health. Ethylmercury is a breakdown product of the antibacteriological agent ethylmercurithiosalicylate, which has been used as a topical antiseptic and a vaccine preservative (further discussed under Thiomersal below). Its characteristics have not been studied as extensively as those of methylmercury. It is cleared from the blood much more rapidly, with a half-life of seven to ten days, and it is metabolized much more quickly than methylmercury. It Ethylmercury is presumed not to have methylmercury ' s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier via a transporter , but instead relies on simple diffusion to enter the brain . Other exposure sources of organic mercury include phenylmercuric acetate and phenylmercuric nitrate. These compounds were used in indoor latex paints for their antimildew properties, but were removed in 1990 because of cases of toxicity.","It is presumed not to have methylmercury's ability to cross the blood–brain barrier via a transporter, but instead relies on simple diffusion to enter the brain.","Ethylmercury is presumed not to have methylmercury's ability to cross the blood–brain barrier via a transporter, but instead relies on simple diffusion to enter the brain.",y,

The song ""The Pride Parade"" provides an insight into McLean's immediate reaction to stardom. McLean told Melody Maker in 1973 that Tapestry was an album by someone previously concerned with external situations. American Pie combines externals with internals, and the resultant success of that album makes the third one (Don McLean) entirely introspective."" Other songs written by McLean for the album include ""Dreidel"" (number 21 on the Billboard chart) and ""If We Try"" (number 58), which was recorded by Olivia Newton-John. ""On the Amazon"" from the 1920s musical Mr. Cinders was an unusual choice but became an audience favorite in concerts and featured in Till Tomorrow, a documentary film about McLean produced by Bob Elfstrom (Elfstrom held the role of Jesus Christ in Johnny and June Cash's Gospel Road). The film shows McLean in concert at Columbia University as he was interrupted by a bomb scare. He left the stage while the audience stood up and checked under their seats for anything that resembled a bomb.

McLean said ""The last album (Don McLean) was a study in depression whereas the new one (Playin' Favorites) is almost the quintessence of optimism."" The 1974 album Homeless Brother , produced by Joel Dorn , was Don McLean ' s final studio recording for United Artists . The album featured fine New York session musicians, including Ralph McDonald on percussion, Hugh McCracken on guitar and a guest appearance by Yusef Lateef on flute. The Persuasions sang the background vocals on ""Crying in the Chapel"", and Cissy Houston provided a backing vocal on ""La La Love You"". The album's title song was inspired by Jack Kerouac's book Lonesome Traveler, in which Kerouac tells the story of America's ""homeless brothers"" or hobos. The song features background vocals by Pete Seeger. The song ""The Legend of Andrew McCrew"" was based on an article published in The New York Times concerning a black Dallas hobo named Anderson McCrew who was killed when he leapt from a moving train. No one claimed him, so a carnival took his body, mummified it, and toured all over the South with him, calling him ""The Famous Mummy Man."" McLean's song inspired radio station WGN in Chicago to tell the story and give the song airplay in order to raise money for a headstone for McCrew's grave. Their campaign was successful, and McCrew's body was exhumed and buried in the Lincoln Cemetery in Dallas. Joel Dorn later collaborated on the McLean career retrospective Rearview Mirror, released in 2005 on Dorn's label, Hyena Records. In 2006, Dorn reflected on working with McLean: Of the more than 200 studio albums I've produced in the past 40 plus years, there is a handful; maybe 15 or so that I can actually listen to from top to bottom. Homeless Brother is one of them. It accomplished everything I set out to do. And it did so because it was a true collaboration. Don brought so much to the project that all I really had to do was capture what he did, and complement it properly when necessary.","The 1974 album Homeless Brother, produced by Joel Dorn, was McLean's final studio recording for United Artists.","The 1974 album Homeless Brother, produced by Joel Dorn, was Don McLean's final studio recording for United Artists.",y,

The locomotive units strongly resembled the EMD NW3, with a long frame, Blomberg B road trucks, and a large cab connected to a wide area of hood that tapered going forward. The locomotives incorporated the machinery of the EMD FT in switcher bodywork; a V16 EMD 567 diesel engine of 1,350 horsepower (1,010 kW) in each unit. The cow and calf units were semipermanently coupled together with a drawbar instead of couplers, in similar fashion to the FT's twin-unit sets.

done,"Dilophosaurus [HEAD] Classification [SEP] Welles thought Dilophosaurus a megalosaur in 1954, but revised his opinion in 1970 after discovering that it had crests. By 1974, Welles and the paleontologist Robert A. Long found Dilophosaurus to be a ceratosauroid. In 1984 Welles found that Dilophosaurus exhibited features of both Coelurosauria and Carnosauria, the two main groups into which theropods had hitherto been divided, based on body size, and he suggested this division was inaccurate. He found Dilophosaurus to be closest to those theropods that were usually placed in the family Halticosauridae, particularly Liliensternus. In 1988, paleontologist Gregory S. Paul classified the halticosaurs as a subfamily of the family Coelophysidae, and suggested that Dilophosaurus could have been a direct descendant of Coelophysis. Paul also considered the possibility that spinosaurs were late-surviving dilophosaurs, based on similarity of the kinked snout, nostril position, and slender teeth of Baryonyx. In 1994, paleontologist Thomas R. Holtz placed Dilophosaurus in the group Coelophysoidea, along with but separate from the Coelophysidae. He placed the Coelophysoidea in the group Ceratosauria. In 2000, paleontologist James H. Madsen and Welles divided Ceratosauria into the families Ceratosauridae and Dilophosauridae, with Dilophosaurus as the sole member of the latter family. Lamanna and colleagues pointed out in 1998 that since Dilophosaurus was discovered to have had crests on its skull, other similarly crested theropods have been discovered (including Sinosaurus), and that this feature is, therefore, not unique to the genus, and of limited use for determining interrelationships within their group. Paleontologist Adam M. Yates described the genus Dracovenator from South Africa in 2005, and found it closely related to Dilophosaurus and Zupaysaurus. His cladistic analysis suggested they did not belong in the Coelophysoidea, but rather in the Neotheropoda, a more derived (or ""advanced"") group. He proposed that if Dilophosaurus was more derived than the Coelophysoidea, the features it shared with this group may have been inherited from basal (or ""primitive"") theropods, indicating that theropods may have passed through a ""coelophysoid stage"" in their early evolution. In 2007, paleontologist Nathan D. Smith and colleagues found the crested theropod Cryolophosaurus to be the sister species of Dilophosaurus, and grouped them with Dracovenator and Sinosaurus. This The Dilophosaurus clade was more derived than the Coelophysoidea , but more basal than the Ceratosauria , thereby placing basal theropods in a ladder - like arrangement . In 2012, Carrano and colleagues found that the group of crested theropods proposed by Smith and colleagues was based on features that relate to the presence of such crests, but that the features of the rest of the skeleton were less consistent. They instead found that Dilophosaurus was a coelophysoid, with Cryolophosaurus and Sinosaurus being more derived, as basal members of the group Tetanurae.","This clade was more derived than the Coelophysoidea, but more basal than the Ceratosauria, thereby placing basal theropods in a ladder-like arrangement.","The Dilophosaurus clade was more derived than the Coelophysoidea, but more basal than the Ceratosauria, thereby placing basal theropods in a ladder-like arrangement.",n,should have been replaced with 'Cryolophosaurus'

To this end it established the wolfpack Schill off the coast of Portugal, to intercept convoys sailing to and from Gibraltar, Mediterranean and South Atlantic. Schill comprised ten U-boats, and commenced operations on 25 October. Its first action was against home-bound convoy SL 138/MKS 28. During this assault the freighter Hallfried was sunk by U-262 on 29 October; however U-306 was sunk by convoy escorts Whitehall and Geranium on 31 October. Following this attack, Schill remained on patrol, but had no further successes. On 9 November, U-707 was caught and sunk by Allied aircraft, a B-17 of 220 Squadron. On 16 November Schill was reinforced and re-organized into three groups. The first, Schill 1, of eight U-boats, was the southernmost rake, running in a line to the west of Lisbon. The second, Schill 2, of nine U-boats, was aligned west of Cape Finisterre in Spain, while the third, Schill 3, of nine U-boats, was 150 nautical miles (280 km) north of this, roughly along the 45th parallel. On 18 November U-boats of Schill 1 opened the attack on convoy SL 139/MKS 30; over the next three days the boats of all three Schill groups were involved with three U-boats destroyed. On 18 November U-211 was sunk by a Wellington, and on the 19th U-536 by Nene and Snowberry.

JD, accompanied by Kait and Del, conduct frequent raids on COG fortifications to acquire various supplies. The three successfully fend off a COG counterattack only to have their encampment devastated by a new foe, called the Swarm. Kait's mother, Reyna, is captured during the chaos. JD, Kait, and Del reach out to Marcus, a disgruntled COG expatriate, who reluctantly agrees to help them. The COG, led by First Minister Mina Jinn, pursue the group after erroneously believing they are behind a string of kidnappings. The four reach a Locust burial site, where they uncover evidence suggesting that Adam Fenix's countermeasure caused the Locust Horde to enter a cocooned metamorphosis state. Their fears are confirmed when various Locust Horde soldiers attack them in conjunction with the Swarm. The group receives assistance from Damon Baird along with Augustus Cole and Samantha Byrne. They battle their way to the Swarm's hive and defeat multiple Swarm and Locust monstrosities. However, they reach the hive to learn that Swarm's hive-mind has forcefully integrated with Reyna. Kait frees her mother, knowing she will die but will no longer suffer. Reyna gives Kait a parting gift that belonged to her mother – a necklace bearing the insignia of the Locust Queen, Myrrah. Kait, JD, Del, and Marcus rejoin the COG and offer their intelligence to Jinn in order to help fight the Swarm. Kait begins to have nightmares and visions related to her mother, the Swarm, and the Locust - but refuses to tell the others about it. Marcus and Baird believe they will need the Hammer of Dawn back online to help defend against the upcoming war with the Swarm. Baird then uncovers additional Hammer of Dawn satellites at Azura. In Gears 5, JD, Kait, Del, and Marcus travel to Azura to launch the Hammer of Dawn satellites. Afterwards, they assist in the evacuation of Settlement 2 as the Swarm have begun their attack on COG Settlements. Four months later, Kait is captured by the Swarm and connects her to the Swarm hivemind, allowing her to control the Swarm to kill the humans, including her uncle. She is freed by Marcus and JD, but in her grief reveals that she has been having visions and nightmares and believes them to be messages by the Swarm, as evidenced by her amulet which bears the Locust symbol.

Khavarani started his career as an architect. In 1965, his conceptual design for the City Theater of Tehran was selected by an international jury. Khavarani moved to the United States in 1981. After he took residency in Los Angeles, California he had to start his architectural career all over. His first project in the States was in Beverly Hills. After the completion of that project in 1984, Khavarani won the CALBO Award of Excellence in the single-family category. He later designed the World Trade Bank of Beverly Hills, for which he won a design award from the City of Beverly Hills Architectural Commission. Khavarani took painting more seriously after arriving in the States. In the 1990s, he started studying philosophy and found inspiration in the works of the Persian poet Rumi.

done,"Lake trout [HEAD] Life history [SEP] Lake trout inhabit cold, oxygen-rich waters. They are pelagic during the period of summer stratification in dimictic lakes, often living at depths of 20–60 m (66–197 ft). The lake trout is a slow-growing fish, typical of oligotrophic waters. It is also very late to mature. Populations are extremely susceptible to overfishing. Many native lake trout populations have been severely damaged through the combined effects of hatchery stocking (planting) and over harvest. Another threat to lake trout is acidification, which can have longterm effects on their populations through both direct harm and reduced prey populations (e.g. Mysis relicta). There are three subspecies of lake trout. There is the common lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush namaycush), the siscowet lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush siscowet), and the less common rush lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush huronicus). Some lakes do not have pelagic forage fish during the period of summer stratification. In these lakes, lake trout take on a life history known as planktivory. Lake trout in planktivorous populations are highly abundant, grow very slowly and mature at relatively small sizes. In those lakes that do contain deep-water forage, lake trout become piscivorous. Piscivorous lake trout grow much more quickly, mature at a larger size and are less abundant. Notwithstanding differences in abundance, the density of biomass of lake trout is fairly consistent in similar lakes, regardless of whether the lake trout populations they contain are planktivorous or piscivorous. In Lake Superior, common lake trout (S. n. namaycush) and siscowet lake trout (S. n. siscowet) live together. Common lake trout tend to stay in shallower waters, while siscowet lake trout stay in deeper water. Common lake trout (also called ""lean"" lake trout) are slimmer than the relatively fat siscowet. Siscowet numbers have become greatly depressed over the years due to a combination of the extirpation of some of the fish's deep water coregonine prey and to overexploitation. Siscowet tend to grow extremely large and fat and attracted great commercial interest in the last century. Their Lake trout populations have rebounded since 1970 , with one estimate putting the number in Lake Superior at 100 million . Professor of zoology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, James Kitchell, credits effective constraint of commercial fisheries and persistent sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) control for the successful recovery of Lake Superior's lake trout. ""Looking at what has happened in the lake and the results of computer simulations, it is clear that lamprey control needs to continue if Lake Superior is to keep its lake trout.""","Their populations have rebounded since 1970, with one estimate putting the number in Lake Superior at 100 million.","Lake trout populations have rebounded since 1970, with one estimate putting the number in Lake Superior at 100 million.",n,should have been replaced with 'siscowet'

In reality , they farmers in India need to still pay for expensive pesticides and irrigation systems , which might lead to increased borrowing to finance the change from traditional seed varieties . Many farmers have difficulty in paying for the expensive technologies, especially if they have a bad harvest. These high costs of cultivation push rural farmers to take out loans—typically at high interest rates. Over-borrowing commonly entraps farmers into a cycle of debt.

The first Green Revolution, she suggests, was mostly publicly funded (by the Indian Government). This new Green Revolution, she says, is driven by private (and foreign) interest—notably MNCs like Monsanto—as encouraged by the neoliberal context. Ultimately, this is leading to foreign ownership over most of India's farmland, undermining farmers' interests. Farmer's financial issues have become especially apparent in Punjab, where its rural areas have witnessed an alarming rise in suicide rates. Excluding the countless unreported cases, there has been estimated to be a 51.97% increase in the number of suicides in Punjab in 1992–93, compared to the recorded 5.11% increase in the country as a whole. According to a 2019 Indian news report, indebtedness continues to be a grave issue affecting Punjabi people today, demonstrated by the more than 900 recorded farmer committed suicide in Punjab in the last two years.","In reality, they need to still pay for expensive pesticides and irrigation systems, which might lead to increased borrowing to finance the change from traditional seed varieties.","In reality, farmers in India need to still pay for expensive pesticides and irrigation systems, which might lead to increased borrowing to finance the change from traditional seed varieties.",y,

This fire was suspected to have been caused by a cigarette within the costume area controlled by the Wakefield Amateur Theatre Guild for a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. The newer presently used buildings were constructed in 1956. In 1972, Thornes House renamed to Thornes House High School. In 1992 , it was proposed to merge Thornes House High School , which had by this point lost its sixth form status , with what was at the time , Cathedral Middle School ( initially founded in 1987 ) . This was done in order to form a Church controlled High School on the site of the former, Upon closure of Thornes House High School, the remaining campuses within Thornes Park were handed over to Wakefield College as their Sports and Fitness educational centre, with a Swimming Pool and other athletic facilities provided on-site. On 31 August 1993, Cathedral Middle School became Cathedral High School, and remained under this name until 2007, when the school rebranded under the leadership of headmaster Paul West, as Cathedral School of the Performing Arts.

done,"Samuel Chester Reid [HEAD] Flag design [SEP] In January 1817, Reid was asked by Representative Peter H. Wendover for advice in the design of a new U.S. flag. The flag then in use had fifteen stars and fifteen stripes; it had not been updated to reflect the five new states which had joined the union since that version of the flag was implemented in 1795. Wendover was the head of a congressional committee tasked with investigating possible alterations to the flag. Together, Wendover and Reid decided that the best way to honor all twenty states was to restore the number of stripes to the original thirteen, have twenty stars on the canton, and add a new star each time a new state joined the union. Reid sketched three flag designs, one for general use which featured the twenty stars arranged in the shape of a larger star, one for use on government vessels and buildings which featured an eagle on the canton instead of stars, and one for use on ceremonial occasions which featured a different element (stars, stripes, the Great Seal, and the Goddess of Liberty) on each of the flag's four quarters. In January 1817 , Representative Peter H . Wendover and his congressional committee adopted Samuel Chester Reid ' s general - use flag , but never seriously considered his other two designs . Wendover drafted a bill which stipulated that the thirteen-stripe, twenty-star design become the new official flag of the United States. The bill passed and was signed into law as the Flag Act of 1818 by President James Monroe on April 4, 1818. The pattern of the stars was later changed from Reid's ""great star"" design to four rows of five stars each. Reid was appointed master in the Navy in 1844 and died at New York 28 January 1861. He is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Four ships were given the name USS Reid in his honor. His daughter, Mary Isabel Reid, married in 1861 Italian-American officer Luigi Palma di Cesnola, who later received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the American Civil War (1863), served as the United States consul in Cyprus (1866–77) and became the first Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (1879-1904).

In 1926 he composed his first tango, Perro fiel, and the next year it was played by the orchestra of the Teatro Nuevo, conducted by Antonio Lozzi. In 1929 he temporarily switched to playing the piano, playing in the evenings of the 'Metropol'. Later, he played in the orchestras of Juan Maglio Pacho, Roberto Firpo, Tirigall, Manuel Buzón, Anselmo Aieta, Pardo, with whom he released his tango Desvelo, Avile, and Antonio Rodio. When Gobbi played with the orchestra of Manuel Buzón, he met the pianists Orlando Goñi and Jaime Gosis. They left to form a sextet along with Aníbal Troilo and Alfredo Attadia on bandoneons, José Goñi on second violin, and Agustín Furchi on double bass. Later Gobbi would join a duo with Osvaldo Pugliese , the Pedro Laurenz orchestra in which he was first violin , and the orchestras of Joaquín Do Reyes , Balliot and in Montevideo that of Pintín Castellanos . At the same time he composed a number of works, including Desvelo (1928), Mi paloma, De punta y hacha (1930) y Cavilando, El andariego (a homage to his father) — which placed him in the most celebrated composers of his generation. In 1942 he formed his first orchestra, which debuted in the Sans Souci cabaret. Gobbi conducted and played the violin alongside the pianist Juan Olivero Pro, bandoneonists Deolindo Casaux, Toto D'Amario, Mario Demarco and Ernesto Rodríguez, double bassist Juan José Fantin, violinists Bernardo Hermino and Antonio Blanco, and the singers Julio Lucero (the pseudonym of Osvaldo Ribó), Walter Cabral, and Pablo Lozano. In 1945 he debuted on the radio, and in May 1947 he made his first recording with Vicente Greco's La viruta, and a waltz written by his father, La entrerriana, sung as a duo by Carlos Heredia and Hugo Soler, for the label RCA Victor. This began a discography that lasted until 1957, and which Gobbi's style of playing the tango is most clearly articulated. As well as conducting his orchestra and playing his instrument, Gobbi was also the arranger of the ensemble. Although Gobbi's musical style initially expressed similarities to that of Carlos Di Sarli, as can be heard in the recordings of La viruta by Di Sarli and Gobbi in 1943 and 1947 respectively, he later developed his own style related to that of Julio de Caro. Although Gobbi had less academic training than de Caro, he incorporated and enhanced many of the tango effects of his violin playing in his own. Gobbi died in Buenos Aires on 21 May 1965. He was survived by his wife Flora Rodríguez.","Later Gobbi would join a duo with Osvaldo Pugliese, the Pedro Laurenz orchestra in which he was first violin, and the orchestras of Joaquín Do Reyes, Balliot and in Montevideo that of Pintín Castellanos.","Later Gobbi would join a duo with Osvaldo Pugliese, the Pedro Laurenz orchestra in which he was first violin, and the orchestras of Joaquín Do Reyes, Balliot and in Montevideo that of Pintín Castellanos.",,

Each episode features either two stories that may or may not connect thematically, or a longer full-episode story (often consisting of numerous connected shorter pieces), all of which revolve around Louie. The pieces are interspersed with segments of C.K. 's stand-up comedy, usually performed in small New York comedy clubs, mainly the Comedy Cellar and Carolines in Manhattan. The stand-up in the show consists of original material recorded for the series, and is usually shot from the stage rather than from the more traditional audience perspective. Sometimes these comedy segments are integrated into the stories themselves, other times they simply serve to bookend them with a loosely connected topic. In Season 1, short awkward conversations between Louie and his therapist are also shown occasionally. Episodes in the series have standalone plots, although some recurring roles (Louie's playdate friend Pamela, portrayed by Pamela Adlon, his co-star from Lucky Louie) occasionally provide story arc continuity between episodes. Continuity is not enforced; there were two very different characters and actresses that served as Louie's mother in separate episodes. Episode 7, ""Double Date/Mom"" portrays a very unpleasant woman as Louie's mother, played by Mary Louise Wilson. By contrast, in episode 10, ""God"", a flashback to Louie's childhood shows the young Louie's mother as a very different woman with a nice personality, played by Amy Landecker.

The only deviation from the first past the post ( FPP ) electoral system during this time in New Zealand occurred in the 1908 election when a second ballot system was tried . The elections since 1935 have been dominated by two political parties, National and Labour. Criticism of the FPP system began in the 1950s and intensified after Labour lost elections in 1978 and 1981 despite having more overall votes than National. An indicative (non-binding) referendum to change the voting system was held in 1992, which led to a binding referendum during the 1993 election. As a result, New Zealand has used the mixed-member proportional (MMP) system since 1996. Under MMP, each member of Parliament is either directly elected by voters in a single-member district via FPP or appointed from their party's list. Parliament currently has 120 seats, though some past elections have resulted in overhang. By rarely producing an overall majority for one party, MMP ensures that parties need to come to an agreement with other parties to pass laws.

done,"Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for Multiple Sclerosis [HEAD] Basic research [SEP] The pathologic hallmarks of multiple sclerosis are central inflammation, blood–brain barrier permeability, demyelination, progressive axonal transection, and a reactive astrogliosis. Demyelination is associated with conduction deficits in affected nerves, including conduction block, a major cause of symptoms early in the disease, and has also been linked to axonal loss, which is associated with permanent deficits later in the disease course. Conversely, remyelination is associated with return of conduction and clinical recovery, but remyelination often fails as the disease progresses, for reasons that are not well understood. Research in the CGD Center's laboratory (led by Dr. Gareth John) focuses on the mechanisms that control lesion formation and repair in MS. The laboratory is currently supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, biotech corporations, and private benefactors; work from the laboratory has been published in scientific journals including Nature Medicine and the Journal of Neuroscience. In a recent study, team members identified the soluble mediator interleukin-11 (IL-11) as a factor that potentiates the survival and maturation of oligodendrocytes, the cells in the brain that produce myelin and are the target of immune attack in MS. IL-11 expression is upregulated at the border of remyelinating lesions in MS, and it may represent a potential target for the design of new therapies to promote lesion repair. These findings were recently published (Zhang et al., J. Neurosci. 2006; 26:12174-85 PMID ). Using a related approach, members of the laboratory recently found that signaling through Notch1 receptors is activated in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) in MS lesions. In the developing CNS, Notch1 restricts OPC differentiation, and is permissive for progenitor expansion. Thus, activation of this pathway in the adult may regulate remyelination. To test this hypothesis, the laboratory has targeted Notch1 inactivation to early OPC in genetically modified animals, using OLIG1Cre:Notch112f/12f mice. They have found that remyelination is potentiated in these animals, whereas OPC proliferation is restricted. These results suggest regulation of Notch signaling as a therapeutic avenue to enhance remyelination in MS.

Construction on the project was suspended indefinitely, the MTA announced on July 29, 1985, because of water leakage into the tunnel. The tunnel flooded in summer 1984 during a heavy rainstorm, and even though structural improvements were made to fix the issue, groundwater leaks continued, scattering puddles along 1.5 miles (2.4 km) of the line. On August 3, 1985, Senator Al D'Amato of New York stated that the project was unsafe and called for the suspension of $44 million in federal aid for the project, citing a preliminary report by the United States Department of Transportation inspector general. The report claimed that the NYCTA failed to test the quality of 94% of the concrete poured in the project and that no follow-up work was done even though 23% of the concrete had failed tests after being reexamined. In addition, the report stated that 48,000 cubic yards of concrete had been paid for without evidence of its delivery. UMTA suspended the payments at his request on August 17. It stated that it would consider restoring the funds if the MTA hired an independent consultant completed studies on the tunnels' structural integrity. On August 26, 1985, the MTA hired an independent consultant, Construction Technology Laboratories (CTL), to inspect the tunnel. A preliminary visual inspection by CTL found corrosion on the steel beams and minor cracks in concrete walls. On August 23, the MTA agreed to commit $39 million of its own funds to fix the Archer Avenue and 63rd Street Lines, of which $14 million was given to the Archer Avenue project. Had the UMTA funds not been restored, the MTA would have absorbed the cost by cutting back other projects in its $8.5 billion capital program. On April 9, 1986, the head of UMTA stated that if the 63rd Street and Archer Avenue lines were not completed, he would demand that the NYCTA refund more than $700 million in federal aid used on the projects. The federal government paid for two-thirds of the $1.23 billion spent on the two projects. In June 1986, CTL issued a final report that found that the tunnels of the Archer Avenue and 63rd Street Lines were structurally sound. The report had been ordered by the MTA after UMTA stopped payments on $75 million in grants for the projects, which were 90 percent complete. While the grants were frozen, for a year, the MTA spent $22 million of its own funds to complete existing contracts and to maintain them. The study was requested to show that it was possible to fix leaks and cracks in both projects and an improperly altered ceiling girder in the 63rd Street Tunnel. If the study was approved, work projected to resume in January. It found that there were minor flaws in the projects, such as flaking concrete on a portion of the Archer Avenue tunnel wall, and uneven welds in the altered girder in the 63rd Street Tunnel. The report recommended some rewelding, the removal of stalactites, filling air pockets in some sections of concrete, the removal of debris, waterproofing, and the use of weak electrical charges to prevent corrosion of steel beams. In August 1986, a study by Knight Associates, which cost $300,000, was scheduled to be released. The study analyzed damage done to the switches, signals, lights, pumps, ventilation fans, substations, third rail and escalator and elevator equipment that resulted from years of moisture, vandalism and neglect.

There he built two forts, Fort Halifax (Maine) and Fort Western. In 1755 , he John Winslow was appointed lieutenant - colonel of a provincial regiment raised by Shirley to aid Lieutenant Governor Charles Lawrence of Nova Scotia in his attempts to sweep French Acadian influence from the province , and played an important role at the capture of Fort Beauséjour in June 1755 . During the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755), Winslow was then ordered to proceed to Grand-Pré, Nova Scotia, to remove the Acadian population, as part of the infamous Great Upheaval. Although often believed solely responsible for carrying out the deportation, Winslow was in charge of only one segment of a much larger operation. On 5 September 1755 he informed the assembled Acadian men that they and their families were to be removed from the province. Winslow termed the business ""Very Disagreable to my natural make & Temper,"" in his ""Journal of Colonel John Winslow of the provincial troops, while engaged in removing the Acadian inhabitants from Grand Pre"". The numerous delays in arranging transports caused the deportation to take far longer than had been anticipated, but by November he had shipped 1,510 Acadians to Pennsylvania, Maryland, and other British colonies to the south. He compiled a list of Acadian males deported that can be found at Winslow returned to Massachusetts in November 1755, but only a couple of months later he was appointed by Shirley (then temporary commander-in-chief), to command the provincial troops in an expedition against Fort St. Frédéric, New York. However, in March 1756 the new commander-in-chief, Lord Loudoun, arrived from Britain, and Winslow fought bitterly with him over his proposed integration of the provincial troops with the regulars. The provincial soldiers had enlisted to serve only under their own officers, and feared the hard discipline, with floggings and hangings, that was part of the regular army. And their officers feared that the integration could result in them losing their rank, as they held it only by colonial commission. The issue nearly developed into a mutiny of the provincial troops and a revolt of their officers, but Winslow eventually agreed to the integration under threats from Loudoun. In 1757 Winslow returned to Massachusetts and civilian life. He represented Marshfield in the General Court from 1757 to 1758 and from 1761 to 1765. In 1762 he served as a member of the St Croix River boundary commission, and in about 1766 he moved to Hingham, Massachusetts, where he died in 1774.","In 1755, he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of a provincial regiment raised by Shirley to aid Lieutenant Governor Charles Lawrence of Nova Scotia in his attempts to sweep French Acadian influence from the province, and played an important role at the capture of Fort Beauséjour in June 1755.","In 1755, John Winslow was appointed lieutenant-colonel of a provincial regiment raised by Shirley to aid Lieutenant Governor Charles Lawrence of Nova Scotia in his attempts to sweep French Acadian influence from the province, and played an important role at the capture of Fort Beauséjour in June 1755.",t,"Full name only mentioned in title, but personally I would say this is rather certain because 'he' certainly refers to 'winslow' (the last name)."

un,"Goanna [HEAD] [SEP] A goanna is any one of several species of lizards of the genus Varanus found in Australia and Southeast Asia . Around 80 species of Varanus are known, 25 of which are found in Australia. This varied group of carnivorous reptiles ranges greatly in size and fills several ecological niches. The goanna features prominently in Aboriginal mythology and Australian folklore. Being predatory lizards, goannas are often quite large, or at least bulky, with sharp teeth and claws. The largest is the perentie (V. giganteus), which can grow over 2.5 m (8.2 ft) in length. Not all goannas are so large; pygmy goannas may be smaller than the arm of an adult human. The smallest of these, the short-tailed monitor (V. brevicauda), reaches only 20 cm (8 in) in length. They survive on smaller prey, such as insects and mice. Goannas combine predatory and scavenging behaviours. They prey on any animal they can catch that is small enough to eat whole. They have been blamed by farmers for the death of sheep, though most likely erroneously, as goannas are also eaters of carrion and are attracted to rotting meat. Most goannas are dark-coloured, with greys, browns, blacks, and greens featuring prominently; however, white is also common. Many desert-dwelling species also feature yellow-red tones. Camouflage ranges from bands and stripes to splotches, speckles, and circles, and can change as the creature matures, with juveniles sometimes being brighter than adults. Like most lizards, goannas lay eggs. Most lay eggs in a nest or burrow, but some species lay their eggs inside termite mounds. This offers protection and incubation; additionally, the termites may provide a meal for the young as they hatch. Unlike some other species of lizards, goannas do not have the ability to regrow limbs or tails.",A goanna is any one of several species of lizards of the genus Varanus found in Australia and Southeast Asia.,A goanna is any one of several species of lizards of the genus Varanus found in Australia and Southeast Asia.,,

Hoskins, who spent his summers among the Camp Lena sequoias, chose biblical and classical themed names for the largest trees, and placed wooden name plates twenty feet off the ground on many of the better known ones. After spending several summers studying one giant tree that he named the Hercules Tree, he decided that he could carve out the center of it without damaging the tree, and with the help of a Mr. Meyers between 1897 and 1902 he drilled and hand cut a 12 feet (3.7 m) diameter by 9 feet (2.7 m) high room, to which he added a hinged wooden door.

The Camp Lena tract remained in Hoskins' family until 1913, when it was sold. Although timber sales in 1956 resulted in some logging that was condemned by the Sierra Club, the Hercules Tree and various other large redwoods in the immediate vicinity were exempted. The Hercules Tree was protected for all time in 1977 when the Camp Lena tract was purchased by the State of California and incorporated into the Mountain Home State Demonstration Forest.

The landers carried colour cameras and a soil drill and analyzer, which unfortunately malfunctioned. Each lander made measurements with a nephelometer, mass spectrometer, gas chromatograph, and a cloud-droplet chemical analyzer using X-ray fluorescence that unexpectedly discovered a large proportion of chlorine in the clouds, in addition to sulfur. Strong lightning activity was also detected. In 1982, the Soviet Venera 13 sent the first colour image of Venus's surface and analysed the X-ray fluorescence of an excavated soil sample. The In 1982 , the Soviet Venera 13 probe operated for a record 127 minutes on the planet Venus ' s hostile surface . Also in 1982, the Venera 14 lander detected possible seismic activity in the planet's crust. In December 1984, during the apparition of Halley's Comet, the Soviet Union launched the two Vega probes to Venus. Vega 1 and Vega 2 encountered Venus in June 1985, each deploying a lander and an instrumented helium balloon. The balloon-borne aerostat probes floated at about 53 km altitude for 46 and 60 hours respectively, traveling about 1/3 of the way around the planet and allowing scientists to study the dynamics of the most active part of Venus's atmosphere. These measured wind speed, temperature, pressure and cloud density. More turbulence and convection activity than expected was discovered, including occasional plunges of 1 to 3 km in downdrafts. The landing vehicles carried experiments focusing on cloud aerosol composition and structure. Each carried an ultraviolet absorption spectrometer, aerosol particle-size analyzers, and devices for collecting aerosol material and analyzing it with a mass spectrometer, a gas chromatograph, and an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The upper two layers of the clouds were found to be sulfuric acid droplets, but the lower layer is probably composed of phosphoric acid solution. The crust of Venus was analyzed with the soil drill experiment and a gamma ray spectrometer. As the landers carried no cameras on board, no images were returned from the surface. They would be the last probes to land on Venus for decades.

done,"HMS Archer (D78) [HEAD] Service history ; HMS Archer [SEP] Two days after the conversion was completed, BAVG-1 was transferred to and commissioned in the Royal Navy as part of the Lend-Lease program. On 23 December 1941, three US Navy Grumman F4F Wildcats landed on Archer for trials to the launch accelerator. The accelerator misfired, causing the first aircraft to dive into the sea as sufficient airspeed had not been gained. The remaining two aircraft were successfully flown off. Archer put into the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 24 December 1941 for repairs to the accelerator, which had been damaged in the misfire. On 2 January 1942, Archer successfully completed her sea trials. On 9 January, she sailed down the Delaware River bound for Norfolk, Virginia, where she was to load aircraft for ferrying to the United Kingdom. Her gyro compass failed near Goose Island and then her engines developed problems. After repairs were effected she arrived at Norfolk and on 12 January she embarked eleven Martlet Is. She departed Norfolk on 13 January but was soon in trouble, as her steering developed a fault and her gyro compass failed. Repairs were made and she set course for Kingston, Jamaica. Later that day Archer had a collision with the 4,497 GRT U.S. freighter Brazos some 200 nautical miles (370 km) east of Charleston, South Carolina (). Archer sustained damage to her bow, and eventually settled down at the bow by 5 degrees after the damage and flooding had been contained. Both ships were dead in the water. The 35 crewmembers of Brazos transferred to Archer in their own lifeboats and Brazos sank on 14 January. Archer's captain had radioed for assistance and at first light started to make for the coast, but as her propeller was half out of the water, progress was minimal. On 16 January, Archer rendezvoused with US Coastguard tug Tallapoosa which unsuccessfully attempted to tow Archer. It was decided that Archer should continue under her own power until a more powerful tug could assist her. On 17 January 1942 , Cherokee reached her HMS Archer and proceeded to tow her to Charleston , where she arrived on 21 January . She entered dry dock on 28 January for repairs, which took about six weeks. On 7 March 1942, Archer embarked twelve Martlets for delivery to HMS Illustrious and her own four Fairey Swordfish aircraft of 834 Squadron which had flown out from Jamaica. She sailed on 18 March for San Juan, Puerto Rico, in company with HMS Devonshire and two destroyers as part of Convoy AS 2. On 22 March Archer again had problems with her steering gear. She put into San Juan on 23 March and rejoined the convoy on 24 March. Anti-submarine patrols were carried out without a sighting, although one Swordfish was badly damaged on 30 March when it lost its tailhook and ended up in the safety barrier. Although her engines and gyro compass continued to give trouble, she arrived at Freetown. Sierra Leone on 3 April. On 9 April, Archer's twelve brand new Martlets were transferred to Illustrious and two Martlets from Illustrious were transferred to Archer. On 15 June 1942, one of her Swordfish aircraft became the first ever aircraft to land on Ascension Island. The aircraft's crew were looking for survivors from SS Lyle Park which had been sunk by U-752.

In the 16th century, Spain colonized New Spain and took over the land from the indigenous peoples. Though it is now an independent nation, Mexico retains much of the cultural influence of Spain, including its official religion of Catholicism, the Spanish language, and the importance of machismo - the belief that men are superior to women. Mexico also retains much of the traditional beliefs of the indigenous peoples who first occupied the country. Besides Spanish, there are over one hundred different languages spoken in the country today. As a result, the current medical system involves a mix of traditional and Western medicinal techniques. Traditional beliefs such as Susto, also known as fear of illness, is thought to occur when the soul leaves the body and wanders. It is believed that women experience this more often than men. Empacho, or the dislocation of body functions is often associated with morning sickness in pregnancy because it is believed that the baby is bringing increased energy to the digestive process. Mal de Ojo is another important perceived cause of illness which relates to birth. It is believed that if someone is looked upon with admiration or jealousy that they will become ill themselves.

There are eleven international texts defining crimes against humanity, but they all differ slightly as to their definition of that crime and its legal elements. In 2008, the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative was launched by Professor Leila Nadya Sadat at the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute to address this gap in international law. The Crimes Against Humanity Initiative represents the first concerted effort to address the gap that exists in international criminal law by enumerating a comprehensive international convention on crimes against humanity . On July 30, 2013, the United Nations International Law Commission voted to include the topic of crimes against humanity in its long-term program of work. In July 2014, the Commission moved this topic to its active programme of work based largely on a report submitted by Sean D. Murphy. Professor Sean D.

un,"Kingdom of Bavaria [HEAD] History ; Ludwig I, Maximilian II and the Revolutions [SEP] In 1825, Ludwig I ascended the throne of Bavaria. Under Ludwig, the arts flourished in Bavaria, and Ludwig personally ordered and financially assisted the creation of many neoclassical buildings and architecture across Bavaria. Ludwig also increased Bavaria's pace towards industrialization under his reign. In foreign affairs under Ludwig's rule, Bavaria supported the Greeks during the Greek War of Independence with his second son, Otto being elected King of Greece in 1832. As for politics, initial reforms advocated by Ludwig were both liberal and reform-oriented. However, after the Revolutions of 1830, Ludwig turned to conservative reaction. The Hambacher Fest in 1832 showed the discontent of the population with high taxes and censorship . Bavaria joined the Zollverein in 1834. In 1835, the first German railway was constructed in Bavaria, between the cities of Fürth and Nuremberg. In 1837, the Roman Catholic-supported clerical movement, the Ultramontanes, came to power in the Bavarian parliament and began a campaign of reform to the constitution, which removed civil rights that had earlier been granted to Protestants, as well as enforcing censorship and forbidding the free discussion of internal politics. This regime was short-lived due to the demand by the Ultramontanes of the naturalization of Ludwig I's Irish mistress, Lola Montez, a notorious courtesan and dancer, which was resented by Ludwig, and the Ultramontanes were pushed out. During the Revolutions of 1848, Ludwig abdicated on 20 March 1848 in favour of his eldest son, Maximilian II. The revolutions also brought amendments to the constitution, including changes to the lower house of the Landtag with equal suffrage for every male who paid a direct tax. Maximilian II responded to the demands of the people for a united German state by attending the Frankfurt Assembly, which intended to create such a state. However, when Maximilian II rejected the Frankfurt Constitution in 1849, there was an uprising in the Bavarian Palatinate under Joseph Martin Reichard, which was put down with the support of Prussian forces. However Maximilian II stood alongside Bavaria's ally, the Austrian Empire, in opposition to Austria's enemy, the Kingdom of Prussia. This position was resented by many Bavarian citizens, who wanted a united Germany. In the end Prussia declined the crown offered by the Frankfurt Assembly as the proposed constitution of a German state was perceived to be too liberal and not in Prussia's interests. In the aftermath of the failure of the Frankfurt Assembly, Prussia and Austria continued to debate over which monarchy had the inherent right to rule Germany. A dispute between Austria and the Prince of Hesse-Kassel was used by Austria and its allies (including Bavaria) to promote the isolation of Prussia in German political affairs. This diplomatic insult almost led to war when Austria, Bavaria, and other allies moved troops through Bavaria towards Hesse-Kassel in 1850. However, Prussia backed down to Austria, and accepted of dual leadership. This event was known as the Punctation of Olmütz but also known as the ""Humiliation of Olmütz"" by Prussia. This event solidified the Bavarian kingdom's alliance with Austria against Prussia. When the project to unite the German middle-sized powers under Bavarian leadership against Prussia and Austria (the so-called Trias) failed, Minister-President Von der Pfordten resigned in 1859. Attempts by Prussia to reorganize the loose and un-led German Confederation were opposed by Bavaria and Austria, with Bavaria taking part in its own discussions with Austria and other allies in 1863, in Frankfurt, without Prussia and its allies attending.",The Hambacher Fest in 1832 showed the discontent of the population with high taxes and censorship.,The Hambacher Fest in 1832 showed the discontent of the population with high taxes and censorship.,,
done,"Userkaf [HEAD] Reign ; Activities in Egypt [SEP] Beyond the constructions of his Userkaf ' s mortuary complex and sun temple , little is known of Userkaf . Malek says his short reign may indicate that he was elderly upon becoming pharaoh. Verner sees Userkaf's reign as significant in that it marks the apex of the sun cult, the pharaonic title of ""Son of Ra"" becoming systematic from his reign onwards. In Upper Egypt, Userkaf either commissioned or enlarged the temple of Montu at Tod, where he is the earliest attested pharaoh. Due to structural alterations, in particular during the early Middle Kingdom, New Kingdom and Ptolemaic periods, little of Userkaf's original temple has survived. It was a small mud-brick chapel including a granite pillar, inscribed with the name of the king. Further domestic activities may be inferred from the annals of the Old Kingdom, written during Neferirkare's or Nyuserre's reign. They record that Userkaf gave endowments for the gods of Heliopolis in the second and sixth years of his reign as well as to the gods of Buto in his sixth year, both of which may have been destined for building projects on Userkaf's behalf. In the same vein, the annals record a donation of land to Horus during Userkaf's sixth year on the throne, this time explicitly mentioning ""building [Horus'] temple"". Other gods honoured by Userkaf include Ra and Hathor, both of whom received land donations recorded in the annals, as well as Nekhbet, Wadjet, the ""gods of the divine palace of Upper Egypt"" and the ""gods of the estate Djebaty"" who received bread, beer and land. Finally, a fragmentary piece of text in the annals suggests that Min might also have benefited from Userkaf's donations. Further evidence for religious activities taking place at the time is given by a royal decree found in the mastaba of the administration official Nykaankh buried at Tihna al-Jabal in Middle Egypt. By this decree, Userkaf donates and reforms several royal domains for the maintenance of the cult of Hathor and installs Nykaankh as priest of this cult. Excavations of the pyramid temple of Amenemhat I at Lisht produced a block decorated with a relief bearing the titulary of Userkaf. The block had been reused as a building material. The relief mentions a journey of the king to the temple of Bastet in a ship called ""He who controls the subjects [...]"". While Userkaf chose Saqqara to build his pyramid complex, officials at the time, including the vizier Seshathotep Heti, continued to build their tombs in the Giza necropolis.","Beyond the constructions of his mortuary complex and sun temple, little is known of Userkaf.","Beyond the constructions of Userkaf's mortuary complex and sun temple, little is known of Userkaf.",y,

Its effects are present in France from Brittany, below the Paris Basin to the Ardennes, the Massif Central, the Vosges and Corsica. The Variscan Belt reappears in Sardinia in Italy and in Germany where the Rhine Massif (Ardennes, Eifel, Hunsrück, Taunus and other regions on both sides of Middle Rhine Valley), the Black Forest and Harz Mountains remain as testimony. In southern Iberia it is marked by a classic strike-slip suture zone between very distinct suspect terranes, and clear evidence can be seen of ductile shearing between high-grade metamorphic rocks and lower grade sedimentary rocks in a wide belt north of the Algarve and extending into the northernmost part the autonomous region of Andalusia and southern Extremadura. In the Czech Republic and southwestern Poland the Bohemian Massif is the eastern end of the unmodified Variscan belt of crustal deformation in Europe. Further Variscan developments to the southeast are partly hidden and overprinted by the Alpine orogeny. In the Alps a Variscan core is built by Mercantour, Pelvoux, Belledonne, Montblanc and Aar Massif. Dinaric, Greek and Turkish mountain chains are the southeastern termination of the Variscan proper.

While living in Plano, Licon attended Jasper High School (2009–2011) and swam for Plano Senior High School during his freshman year (2009–2010). At the 2010 5A Texas State Championships as a freshman, Licon placed third in the 200-yard medley relay, third in the 200-yard IM, and third in the 100-yard breaststroke. This would be the only time Licon would participate in high school swimming as he elected to forgo his remaining three years of eligibility. He still currently holds the Plano Senior High School record in the 200-yard medley relay. In 2011, Licon moved to Austin, Texas at the age of 16 to swim for Nitro swim club, while the rest of his family moved back to El Paso. For his final two years of high school, Licon boarded with multiple host families in the surrounding Austin area to maintain an elite level of training that would best set him up for future athletic and academic success. "" It was very hard the first couple of months . I was scared . I was on my own , "" Licon said . ""It forced me to grow up on a whole new level."" Only months after moving cities, Licon won the 200-meter breaststroke at the 2011 Jr. National Championships, posting a 2:16.09. With this time, he finished ahead of his rival and future Olympic gold medalist Gunnar Bentz. In Austin, Licon attended Westlake High School for one semester before briefly moving back to El Paso. For two months in El Paso, he attended El Paso High School before moving back to Austin for the final time in 2012. Back in Austin, he enrolled into, and eventually graduated from Vista Ridge High School. That summer, Licon competed in the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, finishing 19th in the 200-meter breaststroke which qualified him for the 2012 Jr. Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Honolulu, Hawaii. In Hawaii, Licon posted a 2:14.53 in the 200-meter breaststroke to take fourth place. Individually, Licon also placed sixth in the 100-meter breaststroke (1:03.85) and competed in the preliminary swims of the 100-meter butterfly and the 200-meter individual medley. He concluded the meet with a silver medal performance in the 4×100-meter medley relay alongside future Longhorn teammates Jack Conger and Matt Ellis with a 1:02.86 breaststroke split. This silver medal became Licon's first international medal of his swimming career. On October 19, 2012, Licon gave his verbal commitment to swim at the University of Texas at Austin and signed his letter of intent on November 14, 2012.","""It was very hard the first couple of months.

Concerns were raised about the increased probability of the virus entering Croatia because of the number of Chinese workers working on Pelješac Bridge. Some of the institutions in Croatia preemptively reacted to the potential threat. The airports in Croatia were prepared and they started going through passive measures and being vigilant. The Ministry of Health warned those travelling to China to avoid sick people, animals, and markets, not to eat any raw or semi-cooked animals, and to wash their hands often and to notify their doctor of their plans to travel to China. After relieving Milan Kujundžić from the position of Health Minister, on 31 January, Vili Beroš was confirmed as the new Health Minister by the Croatian Parliament. Prime Minister Andrej Plenković cited the coronavirus problem as one of the reasons for the change. Beroš held a meeting with the Ministry's Crisis Headquarters on his first day regarding the coronavirus epidemic. On the same day, the Ministry announced the formation of a National Crisis Headquarters for the COVID-19 pandemic. The Croatian Public Health Institute introduced special health inspection measures on 2 February for persons arriving from China or had been in China recently. On 3 February, Beroš met with Stella Kyriakidou, the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, and Janez Lenarčič, the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, to discuss the situation with the coronavirus. Following a meeting with the EU health ministers on 13 February, Beroš said that the closure of EU borders is a possible measure. Beroš adopted a decision to establish a quarantine unit at the Hospital for Infectious Diseases ""Dr. Fran Mihaljević"" in Zagreb on 21 February, for suspected or confirmed infected persons with coronavirus.

In formal tourneys, the competing problems are not published before they are judged, while in informal tourneys they are.

Formal Chess problem tourneys are often held to commemorate a particular event or person . The World Chess Composing Tournament (WCCT) is a formal tourney for national teams organised by the Permanent Commission of the FIDE for Chess Compositions (PCCC). In both formal and informal tourneys, entries will normally be limited to a particular genre of problem (for example, mate in twos, moremovers, helpmates) and may or may not have additional restrictions (for example, problems in patrol chess, problems showing the Lacny theme, problems using fewer than nine units). Honours are usually awarded in three grades: these are, in descending order of merit, prizes, honourable mentions, and commendations. As many problems as the judge sees fit may be placed in each grade, and the problems within each grade may or may not be ranked (so an award may include a 1st Honourable Mention, a 2nd Honourable Mention, and a 3rd Honourable Mention, or just three unranked Honourable Mentions). After an award is published, there is a period (typically around three months) in which individuals may claim honoured problems are anticipated (that is, that an identical problem, or nearly so, had been published at an earlier date) or unsound (i.e., that a problem has cooks or no solution).

done,"Toussaint Louverture [HEAD] Haitian Revolution ; The Rebellion: 1791–1794 [SEP] Throughout 1792, as a leader in an increasingly formal alliance between the black rebellion and the Spanish, Louverture ran the fortified post of La Tannerie and maintained the Cordon de l'Ouest, a line of posts between rebel and colonial territory. He gained a reputation for his discipline, training his men in guerrilla tactics and ""the European style of war"". After hard fighting, he lost La Tannerie in January 1793 to the French General Étienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux, but it was in these battles that the French first recognised him as a significant military leader. Some time in 1792–93, he adopted the surname Louverture, from the French word for ""opening"" or ""the one who opened the way"". Although some modern writers spell his adopted surname with an apostrophe, as in ""L'Ouverture"", he did not. The most common explanation is that it refers to his ability to create openings in battle. The name is sometimes attributed to French commissioner Polverel's exclamation: ""That man makes an opening everywhere"". Some writers think the name referred to a gap between his front teeth. Despite adhering to royalist views, Louverture began to use the language of freedom and equality associated with the French Revolution. From being willing to bargain for better conditions of slavery late in 1791, he had become committed to its complete abolition. After an offer of land, privileges, and recognising the freedom of slave soldiers and their families, Jean-Francois and Biassou formally allied with the Spanish in May 1793; Louverture likely did so in early June. He had made covert overtures to General Laveaux prior but was rebuffed as Louverture's conditions for alliance were deemed unacceptable. At this time the republicans were yet to make any formal offer to the slaves in arms and conditions for the blacks under the Spanish looked better than that of the French. In response to the civil commissioners' radical 20 June proclamation (not a general emancipation, but an offer of freedom to male slaves who agreed to fight for them) Louverture stated that ""the blacks wanted to serve under a king and the Spanish king offered his protection."" On 29 August 1793 he made his famous declaration of Camp Turel to the blacks of St. Domingue: Brothers and friends, I am Toussaint Louverture; perhaps my name has made itself known to you. I have undertaken vengeance. I want Liberty and Equality to reign in St. Domingue. I am working to make that happen. Unite yourselves to us, brothers and fight with us for the same cause. On the same day, the beleaguered French commissioner, Léger-Félicité Sonthonax, proclaimed emancipation for all slaves in French Saint-Domingue, hoping to bring the black troops over to his side. Initially, this failed, perhaps because Louverture and the other leaders knew that Sonthonax was exceeding his authority. However, on 4 February 1794, the French revolutionary government in France proclaimed the abolition of slavery. For months , Toussaint Louverture had been in diplomatic contact with the French general Étienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux . During this time, his competition with the other rebel leaders was growing, and the Spanish had started to look with disfavour on his near-autonomous control of a large and strategically important region.","For months, Louverture had been in diplomatic contact with the French general Étienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux.","For months, Toussaint Louverture had been in diplomatic contact with the French general Étienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Laveaux.",t,replacement from title

Alterations in diet may provide temporary improvement but will not alter the course of the disease. Genetic counseling can provide families with information regarding risk in future pregnancies. On April 28, 2006 the US Food and Drug Administration approved a Biologic License Application (BLA) for alglucosidase alfa, rhGAA (Myozyme), the first treatment for patients with Pompe disease, developed by a team of Duke University researchers. This was based on enzyme replacement therapy using biologically active recombinant human alglucosidase alfa produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Myozyme falls under the FDA Orphan Drug designation and was approved under a priority review. The FDA has approved Myozyme for administration by intravenous infusion of the solution. The safety and efficacy of Myozyme were assessed in two separate clinical trials in 39 infantile-onset patients with Pompe disease ranging in age from 1 month to 3.5 years at the time of the first infusion. Myozyme treatment clearly prolongs ventilator-free survival and overall survival. Early diagnosis and early treatment leads to much better outcomes. The treatment of Myozyme is not without side effects which include fever , flushing , skin rash , increased heart rate and even shock ; these conditions , however , are usually manageable . Myozyme costs an average of US$300,000 a year and must be taken for the patients' entire life, so some American insurers have refused to pay for it. On August 14, 2006, Health Canada approved Myozyme for the treatment of Pompe disease. On June 14, 2007 the Canadian Common Drug Review issued their recommendations regarding public funding for Myozyme therapy. Their recommendation was to provide funding to treat a very small subset of Pompe patients (Infants less one year of age with cardiomyopathy). On May 26, 2010 FDA approved Lumizyme, a similar version of Myozyme, for the treatment of late-onset Pompe disease. Lumizyme and Myozyme have the same generic ingredient (alglucosidase alfa) and manufacturer (Genzyme Corporation). The difference between these two products is in the manufacturing process. Myozyme is made using a 160-L bioreactor, while Lumizyme uses a 4000-L bioreactor. Because of the difference in the manufacturing process, the FDA claims that the two products are biologically different. Moreover, Lumizyme is FDA approved as replacement therapy for late-onset (noninfantile) Pompe disease without evidence of cardiac hypertrophy in people 8 years and older. Myozyme is FDA approved for replacement therapy for infantile-onset Pompe disease. In July 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the authorization of avalglucosidase alfa.

Microsoft encourages original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to supply computers with Windows pre-installed by presenting their dominance in computer sales and arguing that consumers benefit by not having to install an operating system. Because the price of the license varies depending on discounts given to the OEM and because there is no similar computer that the OEM offers without Windows, there is no immediate way to find the size of the refund. In 2009, Microsoft stated that it has always charged OEMs about $50 for a Windows license on a $1,000 computer. While it is possible to obtain a computer with no or free operating systems, virtually all large computer vendors continue to bundle Microsoft Windows with the majority of the personal computers in their ranges. The claimed increase in the price of a computer resulting from the inclusion of a Windows license has been called the ""Windows tax"" or ""Microsoft tax"" by opposing computer users. The Findings of Fact in the United States Microsoft antitrust case of 1998 established that ""One of the ways Microsoft combats piracy is by advising OEMs that they will be charged a higher price for Windows unless they drastically limit the number of PCs that they sell without an operating system pre-installed. In 1998, all major OEMs agreed to this restriction."" Microsoft also once assessed license fees based on the number of computers an OEM sold, regardless of whether a Windows license was included; Microsoft was forced to end this practice due to a consent decree. In 2010, Microsoft stated that its agreements with OEMs to distribute Windows are nonexclusive, and OEMs are free to distribute computers with a different operating system or without any operating system. Microsoft does not provide refunds for Windows licenses sold through an OEM, including licenses that come with the purchase of a computer or are pre-installed on a computer. According to Microsoft's End User License Agreement for Windows 7 the ability to receive a refund for the operating system is determined by the hardware manufacturer: By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software. Instead, contact the manufacturer or installer to determine its return policy. You must comply with that policy, which might limit your rights or require you to return the entire system on which the software is installed. Acer Inc . has a policy of requiring the customer to return items at his or her own expense , and the balance received by the customer can be as low as €30 . In other cases, vendors have asked that customers requesting refunds sign non-disclosure agreements. Older versions of Microsoft Windows had different license terms with respect to the availability of a refund for Windows: By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software. Instead, contact the manufacturer or installer to determine their return policy for a refund or credit. Based on the updated language, vendors refused to issue partial refunds for Windows licenses, requiring that the computer be returned altogether. In some countries, this practice has been ruled a violation of consumer protection law. Additionally, the EULA for Windows Vista was criticized for being too restrictive.","Acer Inc. has a policy of requiring the customer to return items at his or her own expense, and the balance received by the customer can be as low as €30.","Acer Inc. has a policy of requiring the customer to return items at his or her own expense, and the balance received by the customer can be as low as €30.",y,no actual change

A period of reconstruction and quiet growth followed World War I. On 12 October 1923, the Government granted approval for Cairns to be listed as a city. The opening in 1924 of the Daradgee Bridge outside Innisfail further strengthened connections between Cairns and the rest of Australia. In 1925, a public electricity supply was introduced, and the Cairns High School and Technical College was opened. In 1926, The Cairns Post commemorated the settlement's 50th birthday by publishing a 50-page, large-format historical essay and photo supplement. In 1927, Cairns suffered widespread destruction from Cyclone Willis. The extensive 33-year-old East Trinity dairying, timber and agricultural estate of Glen Boughton, located directly across the inlet from Cairns City, never recovered from its losses. The city's first Council Chambers was opened in 1930. Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, aviation pioneer and grandson of Cairns' first mayor, made an aerial visit in 1932. The South American cane toad was introduced to sugar cane fields to the south of Cairns in early 1935 to assist in the control of the cane beetle. The toxic animal developed into one of the worst feral pests in Australia's history, resulting in ecological disaster to many native species.

un,"Battle of St. Vith [HEAD] The Battle of St. Vith, 16–21 December 1944 ; The fall of St. Vith, 21 December 1944 [SEP] As the trap snapped shut on the Schnee Eifel on 17 December, rapid change was occurring at the headquarters of the 106th Division in St. Vith. Brigadier General Bruce Cooper Clarke, leader of Combat Command-B 7th Armored Division had arrived in the morning, with news that his command was on the road to St. Vith, but would probably not arrive until later that afternoon. This was bad news for Jones, who was hoping for a quick deliverance from his problems by the arrival of organized reinforcements. The situation was not improved by the appearance of a demoralized Colonel Devine with news that German Tiger tanks were right on his heels. With the appearance of German scouts on the hills east of town, Jones decided he had had enough. “I’ve thrown in my last chips.” He told Clarke, and turned over defense of the area to Clarke. Clarke saw his first task as getting his command into St. Vith, and proceeded to the traffic jams on the Rodt – St. Vith road to force his CCB into St. Vith. By midnight of the 17th, he had managed to set up the beginnings of what was called the “horseshoe defense” of St. Vith, a line of units to the north, east and south of town. These units came mainly from the 7th and 9th Armored Divisions, but included troops from the 424th Regiment of the 106th Division, and various supporting artillery, tank, and tank destroyer battalions. As Clarke was cursing and threatening his way through the traffic jams west of St. Vith, Model and Manteuffel were doing the same in the traffic jams east of Schoenberg. Meeting Manteuffel in the confusion, Model ordered him to capture St. Vith on the 18th, giving him control of the Fuhrer Begleit Brigade to make sure the objective would be met. It was not to be however, for the armor brigade had bogged down in the traffic jams, and the 18th and 62nd Volksgrenadiers were busy reducing the Schnee pocket and rebuilding the bridge at Steinbruck. The mechanized combat engineer battalion of the 18th Volksgrenadiers, with a group from the 1st SS Panzer, did attack from the north, but were repelled by counterattacks from the 7th and 9th Armored. The final attack on St . Vith was belatedly launched on 21 December , but by then St . Vith had become more of a liability than an asset . Attacks from the 1st SS Panzer Division had cut the Rodt – St. Vith road, and the advance of the LVIII Panzer Corps south of St. Vith threatened to close a pincer around the entire St. Vith salient at Vielsalm, eleven miles west of St. Vith, trapping most of the First Army. The German attack began at 3 PM with a heavy artillery barrage. The climax of the attack was, once again, the wandering German 506th Heavy Panzer Battalion. Six of these titans attacked from the Schoenberg – St. Vith road against American positions on the Prumberg. Attacking after dark at 5 PM the Tiger tanks fired star shells into American positions, blinding the defenders, and followed up with armor-piercing shell, destroying all the American defending vehicles. Around 9:30 PM, Clarke, who had earlier stated, “This terrain is not worth a nickel an acre to me.” ordered American forces to withdraw to the west. German forces poured into the town, happily looting the remaining American supplies and equipment, in the process creating another traffic jam that prevented pursuit of the American forces.","The final attack on St. Vith was belatedly launched on 21 December, but by then St. Vith had become more of a liability than an asset.","The final attack on St. Vith was belatedly launched on 21 December, but by then St. Vith had become more of a liability than an asset.",,

We had a chance to really focus on what our priorities should be. ... The best schools, the best jobs, the best communities are nothing if they're under ten feet of water. During his campaign in 2011 , Gregory A . Miller identified his top legislative priorities as fiscal accountability and job creation : . Persistent high unemployment has forced too many of our young residents to leave the state for decent job opportunities. Clearly, we must strengthen our efforts to promote economic opportunities. As your state representative, I'll go anywhere, meet with anyone, and never stop working to create high-paying jobs for our citizens. Miller also said that improvements in drainage were essential on both the East and West banks of the Mississippi River. He cited the need for levees in St. Charles Parish strong enough to withstand hurricanes, in order to protect Montz and LaPlace. Miller also committed to stronger ethics laws. Miller won the seat vacated by Representative Gary Smith, Jr., a Democrat who was elected to the Louisiana State Senate. Miller defeated two opponents, one from each party: Republican Emile Garlepied, a former owner of a transportation company, and Democrat Ganesier ""Ram"" Ramchandran, a consulting engineer and a former member of the St. Charles Parish Council (akin to county commissions in other states).

done,"A-League (1995–2004) [HEAD] History [SEP] The origins of the A-League go back to 1986 and 1987 with the creation of three unrelated semi-professional soccer leagues. On the north-west coast, the Western Soccer Alliance (WSA), a summer outdoor league, emerged in response to the collapse of the North American Soccer League. In the southwest United States, the Southwest Indoor Soccer League was created in response to the upsurge in popularity of the Major Indoor Soccer League. Finally, in 1987, the Canadian Soccer League emerged with eight teams across Canada. While the SISL remained virtually unknown to the wider soccer community, the Western Soccer Alliance grew in popularity and inspired the creation of the third American Soccer League in 1988. By the summer of 1989 , these two leagues the Western Soccer Alliance and the American Soccer League began considering a merger . At the same time, the SISL had grown to seventeen indoor teams and had added a summer outdoor schedule, known as the Southwest Outdoor Soccer League with included eight teams. In 1990, the WSA and ASL merged to form the American Professional Soccer League with twenty-two teams across the United States. At the same time, the SISL expanded to fourteen outdoor teams. In 1992, the SISL renamed itself the United States Interregional Soccer League (USISL) and had grown to twenty-one teams. By the 1993 season, the number of teams in the USISL had doubled to forty-two. The mergers between all of these leagues continued in 1993 with the collapse of the Canadian Soccer League. This led to three Canadian teams, the Vancouver 86ers, Toronto Blizzard and Montreal Impact joining the American Professional Soccer League for the 1993 season. So by the summer of 1993, only two outdoor leagues competed for national attention in North America, the United States Interregional Soccer League and the American Professional Soccer League. However, by this time, the USISL was growing and the APSL was shrinking. In 1995, the American Professional Soccer League was down to six teams – two Canadian and four American. It also changed its name to the A-League. At the same time, the rapidly growing USISL had split its teams into two leagues, the fully professional Professional League and the semi-professional Premier League. In 1996, the USISL made one more critical move. It created a Select League with twenty-one of its most successful clubs. With the creation of the Select League, the USISL now competed directly with the A-League for Division II recognition. This led the two leagues, the A-League which was made up the remains of the old Western Soccer Alliance, American Soccer League and Canadian Soccer League, and the USISL to enter merger talks. The creation of Major League Soccer in 1996 as an American Division I league also spurred the merger. In 1997, six of the seven remaining A-League teams – Montreal Impact, Colorado Foxes, Seattle Sounders, Rochester Raging Rhinos, Vancouver 86ers and Atlanta Ruckus, plus two planned A-League expansion teams (Toronto Lynx and Hershey Wildcats) merged with the USISL Select League to form the USISL A-League, a consolidated North American Division II league with twenty-four teams. In 1999, the USISL renamed itself the United Soccer Leagues (USL). The USISL A-League then became the USL A-League. In 2005, the USL A-League was formally renamed the USL First Division or USL-1. It remained the top league of the Canadian soccer pyramid throughout its existence, with Canadian teams vying for the fan created Voyageurs Cup, until 2006 when Toronto FC debuted in MLS, effectively splitting Division 1 status in Canada between the two leagues. Eventually as the standard of play rose in MLS, by 2010 the USL-1 was effectively Division 2 in Canada.","By the summer of 1989, these two leagues began considering a merger.","By the summer of 1989, the Western Soccer Alliance and the American Soccer League began considering a merger.",y,
un,"Peritonitis [HEAD] Diagnosis [SEP] A diagnosis of peritonitis is based primarily on the clinical manifestations described above. Rigidity (involuntary contraction of the abdominal muscles) is the most specific exam finding for diagnosing peritonitis. If focal peritonitis is detected, further work-up should be done. If diffuse peritonitis is detected, then urgent surgical consultation should be obtained, and may warrant surgery without further investigations. Leukocytosis, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, and acidosis may be present, but they are not specific findings. Abdominal X-rays may reveal dilated, edematous intestines, although such X-rays are mainly useful to look for pneumoperitoneum, an indicator of gastrointestinal perforation. The role of whole - abdomen ultrasound examination is under study and is likely to expand in the future . Computed tomography (CT or CAT scanning) may be useful in differentiating causes of abdominal pain. If reasonable doubt still persists, an exploratory peritoneal lavage or laparoscopy may be performed. In people with ascites, a diagnosis of peritonitis is made via paracentesis (abdominal tap): More than 250 polymorphonuclear cells per μL is considered diagnostic. In addition, Gram stain is almost always negative, whereas culture of the peritoneal fluid can determine the microorganism responsible and determine their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents.",The role of whole-abdomen ultrasound examination is under study and is likely to expand in the future.,The role of whole-abdomen ultrasound examination is under study and is likely to expand in the future.,,

Milly and Egg again are close to separation, but a series of events make them realise they deeply care for each other and they remain together. Jamilla Nassim was born in Barnet to an Indian emigrant family and, whilst studying for a law degree, met Egg and they began a relationship. Milly is, at the beginning of the series, a solicitor who has just completed her final training and is a junior partner at Moore Spencer Wright. Milly is hardworking and, despite her relative youth and ethnic background, is keen to secure the best outcomes for her clients. When Egg quits the firm midway through the first series, Milly finds it hard to deal with his apathetic attitude and harbours romantic thoughts towards her boss Michael O’Donnell. At the climax of the first series, Egg and Milly visit a therapist and initially resolve their differences. In the first episode of the second series, Milly meets a new trainee at her firm, Rachel. Initially put out that she wasn’t informed the firm was getting a trainee, Milly and Rachel form an uneasy working relationship, although Milly finds Rachel’s extremely positive demeanour irritating and is jealous of the relationship she has with her boss. After a brief romantic encounter at the end of the first series, Milly embarks on a full-blown affair with O’Donnell in the latter half of the second series, but the relationship ends when she discovers he has lied about separating from his wife. Throughout the second series, the underlying tensions between Milly and Rachel increase- after Warren leaves early in the second series, Rachel wants to move into the shared house that Milly and the others live in which Milly is deeply opposed to. After Miles marries Francesca, Rachel enquires again about the possibility of moving into the shared house, at which point Milly reveals her complete antipathy towards Rachel. Rachel gains revenge by telling Egg about the affair between Milly and O’Donnell, at which point Milly marches across the dancefloor and punches Rachel in the face. 10 years later, Milly and Egg are married with a young son called Oscar. Milly is resentful at having given up a promising career in Law to raise Oscar, whilst Egg has become a successful writer. Although initially planning to separate from Egg, she later reverses her decision and they remain together at the close of the series. Anna Forbes was born in Glasgow. It is revealed in the first episode that her childhood was difficult, with an alcoholic mother who neglected her frequently.

In the first series, Anna interviews for a position at chambers but is unsuccessful. Nonetheless, chambers clerk Jo suggests that she ‘squat’ and undertake supplementary work and unwanted cases in order to earn an income. Anna moves into the shared house and is reunited with her former boyfriend Miles whom she dated at university. The on/off relationship between Miles and Anna is one of the main storylines that runs throughout the entire series. Anna and Miles initially reunite as friends, although Anna is uncomfortable early in the first series when Miles is dating drug addict and thief Delilah and helps to sabotage the relationship. Near the end of the first series, Anna sleeps with Egg’s father Jerry although at a house party to celebrate his book being accepted by a publisher, she hides from him and ends up sleeping with Miles. At the beginning of the second series, Anna sees Miles talking to another woman at a bar and, misunderstanding the situation, thinks he is cheating on her and promptly dumps him.","Despite her difficult upbringing, Anna is a tenacious, charismatic and talented barrister, albeit one who frequently takes risks on behalf of her clients.","Despite her difficult upbringing, Anna is a tenacious, charismatic and talented barrister, albeit one who frequently takes risks on behalf of her clients.",,

After starting the season with two runs over hurdles, he again showed his aptitude for extreme stamina tests as he carried 160 pounds to victory over three miles, five and a half furlongs in the Welsh National in January. McCoy sent him into the lead three fences from the finish and he stayed on strongly to win by two and three quarter lengths. He once again bypassed the Cheltenham Festival, but his attempt to win a second Midlands National ended in failure as he finished third to Minella Four Star under top weight of 166 pounds. On his final start of the season he made no show before being pulled up in the Irish Grand National. He ended the season with an official rating of 155, twenty-seven pounds behind the champion Long Run. The 2011/2012 season began with two more hurdle races before Synchronised was moved up to Grade I class for the first time in the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown Racecourse in December. The gelding established himself as a top-class steeplechaser by taking the lead at the last fence and pulling clear in the closing stages to beat Rubi Light in ""impressive style"" by eight and a half lengths at level weights. The race also showed that Synchronised did not need slow, heavy ground to show his best form. McCoy praised his horse's performance but was not over-enthusiastic about his prospects against the best steeplechasers saying ""I don't think Kauto Star and Long Run will be too worried"".

Ace saves Jordan, who lands in North Korean territory, where he is saved by reporters Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen, but not before Jordan is forced to kill a North Korean soldier who is apparently unaware that the conflict is over. Jordan, who has a strict moral and ethical opposition to murder, chastises himself for not remembering the Korean words that would have potentially saved the man's life. Meanwhile, in the early years of the Vietnam War, Superman meets with Wonder Woman, who has just rescued a village of women kept in slavery by the Viet Cong. Superman criticises Wonder Woman for allowing the women to slaughter their captors, thereby defying international law, and threatens to report her for her actions. Angered, Wonder Woman shows him the door. In 1955, the last surviving member of a Martian race, J'onn J'onzz, arrives on Earth in Gotham City in response to an astronomer's signal. The shock of J'onzz's arrival causes the astronomer to suffer a fatal heart attack, but not before warning J'onzz of humanity's capacity for violence and distrust. Taking note, J'onzz – capable of shape-shifting – assumes the astronomer's identity and later creates the identity of GCPD Detective John Jones, based on what he has learned of human nature through television. He declares that he wishes to be one of the ""good guys"". In 1956, police scientist Barry Allen is struck by lightning, giving him superhuman speed.

Sonthi was granted an extraordinary increase in executive powers to combat unrest in the far South. However, up to 19 September 2006, the Army admitted that they had no idea who the insurgents were.

Previously trapped in an extradimensional Void, Adam is drawn to the Torchwood team due to their unique memories and escapes the Void through the Rift. In less than 48 hours he is able to plant false memories in the team, posing as a member of Torchwood. It is this belief in him that allows him to survive. Accompanying the survival instinct, Adam shows a tendency to use his powers recreationally and maliciously. He provides a drastic role-reversal for both Toshiko, now a promiscuous extrovert who shares a passionate relationship with Adam, and Owen, now a shy geek with unrequited feelings for Toshiko. Adam also provides Jack with a resurgence of the repressed memories of the last pleasant memories of his family before his father ' s death and his brother ' s disappearance . As a side-effect of such new memory creation, other memories must be forced from the mind, leading Gwen to totally forget Rhys. When Ianto looks over his diary and discovers no reference to Adam, Adam attempts to escape by torturing Ianto with false memories of being a serial killer, only for Jack to see through the lie thanks to his knowledge of Ianto's personality. Although Adam tries to threaten Jack by altering his few happy memories of his childhood, Jack nevertheless deals with Adam's existence by giving everyone in the team 48-hour amnesia pills.

When he came into his own he started working for a journal. First as a corrector, later he contributed a serial. In 1877, the generosity of his grandmother permitted young Eekhoud to publish his first two books, Myrtes et Cyprès and Zigzags poétiques, both volumes of poetry. In the beginning of the 1880s Eekhoud took part in several of the modern French-Belgian artist movements, like Les XX (The Twenty) and La Jeune Belgique (Young Belgium). Kees Doorik, his first novel was published in 1883, about the wild life of a tough young farmhand who committed a murder. The renowned free-thinking publisher Henri Kistemaeckers brought out a second edition three years later. Eekhoud received some guarded praise by famous authors like Edmond de Goncourt and Joris-Karl Huysmans who both sent Eekhoud a personal letter. For his second prose book, Kermesses (Fairs, 1884), not only Goncourt and Huysmans praised him, but also Émile Zola, about whom Eekhoud had written an essay in 1879. In 1886 his novel Les milices de Saint-François (The Soldiers of Saint Francis Xavier) was published.

He said, ""No, come on, get ready, get ready; I'll be back at such and such a time. They kind of out for dinner now; you get ready and come and go."" I did. As her sisters grew, married, and had families, Willie Mae continued as a soloist, even after her 1924 marriage to James Smith, a man 19 years her senior who owned a general hauling business. James encouraged her to accept requests to sing in church, and expressed pride in her voice. Willie Mae was a talented soprano who seriously considered a career in classical music. However, at the 1926 National Baptist Convention, she heard a woman named Artelia Hutchins singing in a new style and changed her mind: ""I knew then I had to be a gospel singer."" Having two children, Willie James and Jacquelyn, did not make her any less determined. In 1930, Smith had an auspicious meeting with Thomas A. Dorsey, a blues musician who had attempted to make a living writing gospel music without success. Two years before, Dorsey had a spiritual conversion after a bout of depression. His downstairs neighbor, also a good friend, died unexpectedly, and both events inspired him to write ""If You See My Savior, Tell Him That You Saw Me"". It was the first song Dorsey wrote that combined a blues structure to gospel lyrics. Despite his best efforts, Dorsey found it impossible to sell his sheet music or break into the inner workings of Chicago's black churches. As a blues singer, his involvement in a culture widely considered to be sinful would not have been well received in churches, particularly in a position of leadership, which he was seeking. Dorsey thus had neither the time or interest in attending the National Baptist Convention in his home city of Chicago. Though he had gone in previous years, Dorsey stayed home in 1930. Smith traveled from St. Louis to the convention, with 15,000 attendees, and sang Dorsey's ""If You See My Savior"" to the general morning gathering. Upon hearing her, the audience was greatly moved. Smith performed it twice more on request; Dorsey, who did not know Smith before the convention, was beckoned to rush there where he sold 4,000 copies of his song. It led to his permanent position as music director at Chicago's Pilgrim Baptist Church, allowing him to focus entirely on gospel music. Though Smith went home to St. Louis, Dorsey started the first gospel choir in 1931, and when demand proved it was needed, he co-founded the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses (NCGCC), an organization dedicated to training gospel singers in Chicago and throughout the U.S. the next year.

un,"Radioactive decay [HEAD] [SEP] Radioactive decay (also known as nuclear decay, radioactivity, radioactive disintegration or nuclear disintegration) is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation. A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive. Three of the most common types of decay are alpha decay (𝛼-decay), beta decay (𝛽-decay), and gamma decay (𝛾-decay), all of which involve emitting one or more particles. The weak force is the mechanism that is responsible for beta decay, while the other two are governed by the usual electromagnetic and strong forces. Radioactive decay is a stochastic ( i . e . random) process at the level of single atoms. According to quantum theory, it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay, regardless of how long the atom has existed. However, for a significant number of identical atoms, the overall decay rate can be expressed as a decay constant or as half-life. The half-lives of radioactive atoms have a huge range; from nearly instantaneous to far longer than the age of the universe. The decaying nucleus is called the parent radionuclide (or parent radioisotope), and the process produces at least one daughter nuclide. Except for gamma decay or internal conversion from a nuclear excited state, the decay is a nuclear transmutation resulting in a daughter containing a different number of protons or neutrons (or both). When the number of protons changes, an atom of a different chemical element is created. By contrast, there are radioactive decay processes that do not result in a nuclear transmutation. The energy of an excited nucleus may be emitted as a gamma ray in a process called gamma decay, or that energy may be lost when the nucleus interacts with an orbital electron causing its ejection from the atom, in a process called internal conversion. Another type of radioactive decay results in products that vary, appearing as two or more ""fragments"" of the original nucleus with a range of possible masses. This decay, called spontaneous fission, happens when a large unstable nucleus spontaneously splits into two (or occasionally three) smaller daughter nuclei, and generally leads to the emission of gamma rays, neutrons, or other particles from those products. In contrast, decay products from a nucleus with spin may be distributed non-isotropically with respect to that spin direction. Either because of an external influence such as an electromagnetic field, or because the nucleus was produced in a dynamic process that constrained the direction of its spin, the anisotropy may be detectable. Such a parent process could be a previous decay, or a nuclear reaction. For a summary table showing the number of stable and radioactive nuclides in each category, see radionuclide. There are 28 naturally occurring chemical elements on Earth that are radioactive, consisting of 34 radionuclides (6 elements have 2 different radionuclides) that date before the time of formation of the Solar System. These 34 are known as primordial nuclides. Well-known examples are uranium and thorium, but also included are naturally occurring long-lived radioisotopes, such as potassium-40. Another 50 or so shorter-lived radionuclides, such as radium-226 and radon-222, found on Earth, are the products of decay chains that began with the primordial nuclides, or are the product of ongoing cosmogenic processes, such as the production of carbon-14 from nitrogen-14 in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. Radionuclides may also be produced artificially in particle accelerators or nuclear reactors, resulting in 650 of these with half-lives of over an hour, and several thousand more with even shorter half-lives. (See List of nuclides for a list of these sorted by half-life.)",Radioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e.,Radioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e.,,

imp,"Eclogue 4 [HEAD] Interpretation ; Meaning [SEP] The poem has also been interpreted in more metaphorical ways. Some modern scholars are inclined to believe that the poem celebrates the Treaty of Brundisium, from which sprung forth the Second Triumvirate of Octavian, Marc Antony, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus.. Floyd, on the other hand, proposed that the puer mentioned throughout the poem is not an actual child, but rather Virgilian poetry itself. He noted that the word puer is elsewhere used by Virgil in the Eclogues to refer to shepherds, individuals who are closely associated with the art of poetry. Furthermore, he points out that the verb incipere, which is used three times in Eclogue 4, is itself associated with ""poetic performances"" in other Virgilian poems, like in Eclogue 3.58. Finally, Floyd—who subscribes to the theory that cui non risere parentes is what Virgil wrote—proposed that line 62 refers to a boy whose parents will smile, only ""after due consideration"", meaning that the child must earn its parents' smiles. Floyd goes on to argue that it makes sense for the parents to either be Virgil or the Muses, individuals whose smiles must be earned; the Muses are critical of those whom they inspire, whereas Virgil—as a meticulous artist—was critical of himself. Line 22, which mentions that ""the cattle will not fear huge lions"", has been compared to both Isaiah 11:6 from the Hebrew Bible, which states that, ""The calf and the young lion will grow up together and a little child will lead them"", as well as a passage from the Sibylline Oracles 3.791-3, which reads: ""The lion, devourer of flesh, will eat husks in the stall like an ox, and tiny children will lead them in chains."" Rose proposed that, because Virgil was highly educated and had ""a great taste for philosophic and quasi-philosophic studies"", it is possible that he combined dozens of mystical and religious ideas in the poem, ""joining Sibylline formulae to age-old beliefs about divine kings, taking hints from many doctrines of original sin … with astrological speculations of recent date, and coloring the whole with the theanthropic, or Messianic, expectations."" Due to this synthesis of ideas, Rose points out that it is possible that Virgil used the Hebrew Scriptures for part of the poem's inspiration. Cyrus H. Gordon later noted that the Eclogues, along with the Aeneid ""reflect Egyptian, Semitic, and Anatolian, as well as Greek, antecedents"". Nisbet pointed out that the poem can be analyzed according to two different schools of thought: the ""Easterners"" (promoted notably by Eduard Norden) argue that the eclogue had to have been influenced by religions of the East, most notably Jewish messianism, whereas the ""Westerners"" (furthered by the work of Günther Jachmann) argue that the work was influenced largely by concepts familiar to the Greco-Roman West. Nisbet outlined reasons why certain sections, most notably the seemingly Isaian section in and around line 22, are best explained through the Easterners' method of interpretation. Other sections , however , such as lines 26–36—which Nisbet argued were written in a style akin to Greco - Roman prophecies ( and whose wording suggests "" the ideals of Virgil ' s own society "" ) —should be viewed through the Westerners ' lens . Ultimately, Nisbet concluded that Virgil was not interested in Jewish eschatology ""for its own sake""; however, he probably appropriated elements from Jewish prophecy via Eastern oracles, and adapted them towards Western (which is to say, Roman) modes of thought.","Other sections, however, such as lines 26–36—which Nisbet argued were written in a style akin to Greco-Roman prophecies (and whose wording suggests ""the ideals of Virgil's own society"")—should be viewed through the Westerners' lens.","Other sections, however, such as lines 26–36—which Nisbet argued were written in a style akin to Greco-Roman prophecies (and whose wording suggests ""the ideals of Virgil's own society"")—should be viewed through the Westerners' lens.",,

Throughout the 1980s, the line-up changed and the group matured and sought to branch out in new musical directions. During a hiatus in 1989, and at the suggestion of producers Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, the three decided to form a new group, and were signed by MCA Records. With help from Public Enemy producers Eric Sadler, Hank and Keith Shocklee and several others, Bell Biv Devoe released its debut album Poison in 1990, an album credited as pioneering the ""new jack swing"" sound of the early 1990s, combining hip-hop, funk, soul, and pop music. This fusion of styles helped to expose them to a fan base which preferred a harder edged sound. Poison reached number 1 on Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop chart, and its title track, along with its second single, ""Do Me!,"" both reached number 3 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Shortly thereafter, Richard Wolf and Epic Mazur were responsible for the remix of ""Do Me!"" (which hit number six on the dance charts). Poison also spawned the singles ""B.B.D. (I Thought It Was Me)? "", ""When Will I See You Smile Again?"" and ""She's Dope!"" Poison sold over four million copies, and was followed up by a remix album titled WBBD-Bootcity. Richard Wolf and Epic Mazur helped create BBD Bell Biv DeVoe ' s premiere album , Poison , blending rhythm , blues , pop , and rock , and Poison achieve triple Platinum success . Bell Biv DeVoe released Hootie Mack in 1993 on MCA Records, and the more hardcore rap/R&B influenced BBD in 2001 on Biv 10 Records. Neither album was as successful as Poison, though Hootie Mack did reach Gold success. Despite the fact that the group has only released four albums, the members of Bell Biv Devoe continue to perform together as a group. They also participated in several New Edition reunions, and continue to perform with them on tour as part of the group.

un,"Sex [HEAD] Sex differences ; Sexual dimorphism [SEP] In many animals and some plants, individuals of male and female sex differ in size and appearance, a phenomenon called sexual dimorphism. Sexual dimorphism in animals is often associated with sexual selection—the mating competition between individuals of one sex vis-à-vis the opposite sex. In many cases, the male of a species is larger than the female. Mammal species with extreme sexual size dimorphism tend to have highly polygynous mating systems—presumably due to selection for success in competition with other males—such as the elephant seals. Other examples demonstrate that it is the preference of females that drives sexual dimorphism, such as in the case of the stalk-eyed fly. Females are the larger sex in a majority of animals. For instance, female southern black widow spiders are typically twice as long as the males. This size disparity may be associated with the cost of producing egg cells, which requires more nutrition than producing sperm: larger females are able to produce more eggs. Sexual dimorphism can be extreme, with males, such as some anglerfish, living parasitically on the female. Some plant species also exhibit dimorphism in which the females are significantly larger than the males, such as in the moss genus Dicranum and the liverwort genus Sphaerocarpos. There is some evidence that, in these genera, the dimorphism may be tied to a sex chromosome, or to chemical signalling from females. In birds, males often have a more colourful appearance and may have features (like the long tail of male peacocks) that would seem to put them at a disadvantage (e.g. bright colors would seem to make a bird more visible to predators ) . One proposed explanation for this is the handicap principle.

done,"Battle of Vukovar [HEAD] Political aspects ; Croatian reaction [SEP] The Croatian media gave heavy coverage to the battle, repeatedly airing broadcasts from the besieged town by the journalist Siniša Glavašević. Much popular war art focused on the ""VukoWAR"", as posters dubbed it. The Croatian government began suppressing Glavašević's broadcasts when it became clear that defeat was inevitable, despite the confident slogans of ""Vukovar shall not fall"" and ""Vukovar must not fall."" Two of the main daily newspapers, Večernji list and Novi list, failed to report the loss of Vukovar and, on 20 November, two days after it had fallen, repeated the official line that the fight was still continuing. News of the surrender was dismissed as Serbian propaganda. Many Croatians soon saw Western satellite broadcasts of JNA soldiers and Serb paramilitaries walking freely through the town and detaining its inhabitants. When the surrender could no longer be denied, the two newspapers interpreted the loss as a demonstration of Croatian bravery and resistance, blaming the international community for not intervening to help Croatia. The Croatian government was criticised for its approach to the battle. Surviving defenders and right-wing politicians accused the government of betraying and deliberately sacrificing Vukovar to secure Croatia's international recognition. The only explanation that many were willing to accept for the town's fall was that it had been given up as part of a conspiracy. The Croatian commanders in Vukovar, Mile Dedaković and Branko Borković, both survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the government's actions. In an apparent attempt to silence them, both men were briefly detained by the Croatian military police. The Croatian government also suppressed an issue of the newspaper Slobodni tjednik that published a transcript of a telephone call from Vukovar, in which Dedaković had pleaded with an evasive Tuđman for military assistance. The revelations caused public outrage and reinforced perceptions that the defenders had been betrayed. From a military point of view, the outcome at Vukovar was not a disaster for Croatia's overall war effort. The battle broke the back of the JNA, leaving it exhausted and unable to press deeper into the country. Vukovar was probably indefensible, being almost completely surrounded by Serb-held territory and located closer to Belgrade than to Zagreb. Although the defeat at the Battle of Vukovar was damaging to Croatian morale , in a strategic context , the damage and delays inflicted on the JNA more than made up for the loss of the town . Following the battle, Vukovar became a symbol of Croatian resistance and suffering. The survivors, veterans and journalists wrote numerous memoirs, songs and testimonies about the battle and its symbolism, calling it variously ""the phenomenon"", ""the pride"", ""the hell"" and ""the Croatian knight"". Writers appealed to the ""Vukovar principle"", the ""spirituality of Vukovar"" and ""Vukovar ethics"", the qualities said to have been exhibited by the defenders and townspeople. Croatian war veterans were presented with medals bearing the name of Vukovar. In 1994, when Croatia replaced the Croatian dinar with its new currency, the kuna, it used the destroyed Eltz Castle in Vukovar and the Vučedol Dove – an artefact from an ancient Neolithic culture centred on eastern Slavonia, which was discovered near Vukovar – on the new twenty-kuna note. The imagery emphasised the Croatian nature of Vukovar, which at the time was under Serb control. In 1993 and 1994, there was a national debate on how Vukovar should be rebuilt following its reintegration into Croatia, with some Croatians suggesting that it should be preserved as a monument.","Although the defeat was damaging to Croatian morale, in a strategic context, the damage and delays inflicted on the JNA more than made up for the loss of the town.","Although the defeat at the Battle of Vukovar was damaging to Croatian morale, in a strategic context, the damage and delays inflicted on the JNA more than made up for the loss of the town.",t,"battle' and 'vukovar' do appear, but not together in caps"

The liquid matter had come from a glaciated lake just below the surface. The inrush occurred at the point where the No. 5 Heading (or Drift) was being driven towards the surface at a gradient of 1 in 2. The inrush of liquid rushed back down the incline filling miles of underground workings and sealing off all escape routes to the surface. One hundred and thirty-five men were underground at the time. Six working close to the pit bottom managed to escape before they were sealed in by the sludge. Another 116 miners found themselves cut-off from the pit bottom. However , a further 13 men were unaccounted for . As the men remained trapped underground, rescue teams began to try and reach them before they were engulfed by the encroaching sludge or they were overcome by the rapidly deteriorating air quality and gas. A telephone line to the surface remained intact, allowing the trapped miners to provide details of their location to their rescuers. British Pathe News described this as ""a truly remarkable story of how ordinary men worked tirelessly in a race against time and the forces of nature to achieve one of the most dramatic and remarkable rescues ever attempted."" After three days, the men were eventually rescued by being led through the old disused gas-filled Bank No. 6 mine workings which ran close to Knockshinnoch.

imp,"The Revelation (Coldrain album) [HEAD] Critical reception [SEP] The debut worldwide studio album, The Revelation, received a polarised response from critics as a whole. The positive reviews were very favourable, however the release received an amount of negative reviews as well. The main praises for The Revelation consisted of the melodies and clean vocals by frontman Masato Hayakawa. Max Barrett of Rock Sound, who rated the album a 6/10, noted that: ""With the quality to fuse a mature, melodic approach with their ear for a clean and catchy chorus (""Given Up On You""), the Nagoya-based quintet make it virtually impossible to simply sit still and listen. Chuck in the more venomous, metalcore-esque sections (the title track), not to mention the odd ripping solo (""Time Bomb""), and there’s enough variation here to formally introduce Coldrain to the world."" This point was reiterated by Kersten Lison of Twilight Magazine, ""The metalcore is extremely dynamic and energetic. In addition, it can convince with a pleasant note of melodic, which is extremely catchy and catchy, but without drifting into the arbitrary. This gives the sound an enormous lightness despite the genre-typical hardness, which is otherwise very rarely heard in this form (""Behind The Curtain""). Just the right thing for the summer. Almost like a pleasantly cooling summer rain."" Many of the songs were strongly praised by DJ Robintje who wrote for Avo-Magazine, who would comment on the anthem like sing-a-long ""The War is On"". """"The War Is On"" begins with a gentle, relatively short intro. This is followed up by singing which begins slowly and then introduces soft grunts. The alternation between the vocals and the grunting has a pleasant balance. Drums and guitar are clearly present, with a strong and compelling rhythm. Despite the rather dark vocals you will immediately be in the mood to join in, which makes me want to scream along with the chorus. Certainly a song that will catch on during live performances."" They would then also go on to praise the highly diverse ""Time Bomb"", ""Time for the fifth song named ""Time Bomb"". This track begins with a guitar intro and some solid bass lines. The vocalist sounds more dynamic and aggressive than before, which is supported by reverbs during the rush part. The guitar plays a very important role in this track which is complemented by a very nice beat. The guitar solo later in the song is fantastic! A song with a lot of variety, which still forms a beautiful whole."" However, on a more negative review, Rasmus Peters of Metal.de would highly criticise the lack of originality on the record as a whole. ""Lyrically on the paths of Bullet for My Valentine, but without getting to the choruses or kindness sits or kindness that they have or had without any doubt. Even Linkin Park, when they were still being worshipped on every conventional schoolyard, are a long way off for Coldrain. It simply lacks every spark of originality , no small of it .

done,"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues [HEAD] The Ed Sullivan Show controversy [SEP] ""Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues"" was at the center of a controversy that brought national attention to Dylan and played a significant part in shaping his second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. On May 12, 1963, with the album about to be released, Dylan was scheduled to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show on CBS. The Sunday evening variety show, among the most popular shows on American television, had earlier introduced Elvis Presley to national audiences and in 1964 would do the same for The Beatles. Dylan had auditioned for the show in early 1962, before the release of his first album. He played a few songs from the recording, but the network executives who sat in on the set were not exactly sure what to make of him. Unhappy with the experience, Dylan thought he would not hear from the network again. More than a year passed when the call came inviting him to make a guest appearance on the show. For his one selection, Dylan chose ""Talkin' John Birch Society Blues"" (as it was then titled). Ed Sullivan and his producer heard him play it at the Saturday rehearsal on May 11 and were delighted with the song. However , when When Bob Dylan showed up for the dress rehearsal the next afternoon , the day of the show , a CBS program practices executive told him the song would have to be replaced because of possible defamation against John Birch Society members . Refusing to do a different song, Dylan walked off the set. The incident drew national attention with reports running in The New York Times, Billboard and The Village Voice. Sullivan, meanwhile, backed Dylan, arguing that if network programs could poke fun at President John F. Kennedy, the John Birch Society should not be immune from similar treatment. Concerned about possible reprisals from the John Birch group, the network held to its decision. Then the controversy spilled over into Columbia, CBS's records division. When the company's lawyers learned that ""Talkin' John Birch"" was slated for the album, they ordered the song removed. Dylan was in a delicate situation. His first album had sold poorly, and he did not have the power at this point to fight his record company. Though upset by the order, he relented. The initial shipments of Freewheelin, which had already been sent out, were recalled, and the album was re-issued without ""Talkin' John Birch Society Blues"". Per a 2012 report, early copies of the record that feature ""Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues"" are worth as much as $20,000. Dylan ultimately profited from the affair. Besides the favorable publicity from The Ed Sullivan Show walk-out, it gave him a chance to re-consider his selections for Freewheelin, which he felt had too many ""old fashioned"" selections, songs closer in style to his earlier material. In addition to ""Talkin' John Birch Society"", he dropped three of his other older songs, including ""Let Me Die In My Footsteps"", ""Ramblin' Gamblin' Willie"" and ""Rocks and Gravel"". In their place, he substituted four tunes recorded during the last of the Freewheelin' sessions: ""Masters of War"", ""Girl from the North Country"", ""Bob Dylan's Dream"" and ""Talkin' World War III Blues"".","However, when Dylan showed up for the dress rehearsal the next afternoon, the day of the show, a CBS program practices executive told him the song would have to be replaced because of possible defamation against John Birch Society members.","When Bob Dylan showed up for the dress rehearsal the next afternoon, the day of the show, a CBS program practices executive told him the song would have to be replaced because of possible defamation against John Birch Society members.",y,bob dylan' appears throughout

imp,"Severo Fernández [HEAD] Political career ; Presidency [SEP] Like his predecessor, Mariano Baptista, Fernández was a more conciliatory and legalist breed of Conservative. He presided over the collapse of Conservative Party rule and its loss of power in the aftermath of the 1899 Civil War against the Liberal Party. A disgruntled Liberal Party had become increasingly frustrated during the many years of Conservative dominance, often attained by electoral fraud. After 1894, led by the combative José Manuel Pando, a former military hero in the War of the Pacific, the Liberals' calls for anti-government rebellions became more strident, but they were always neutralized by a loyal military establishment. All of this changed radically with the emergence of a new , and very polarizing , wedge issue : the simmering displeasure in the cities of Sucre and Potosi , dating back to the days of President Andrés de Santa Cruz ( 1829–39 ) , regarding the de facto takeover by the city of La Paz as the seat of the Bolivian government . The regional conflict also had much to do with the emergence of a new tin-mining elite based in La Paz and Oruro, to the detriment of the old silver-mining establishment based in Sucre and Potosi, as symbolized by Conservative leaders such as Arce and Pacheco (both silver tycoons). To add fuel to the fire, the Liberals called for a federal decentralization of power, thus garnering further support from outlying regions of the country. Civil War (often called the ""Federal Revolution"") exploded when Chuquisaca and Potosi parliamentarians in Sucre passed a ""Law of Confinement,"" which ordered the President to reside in Sucre and issue decrees from there, rather than from La Paz. For their part, La Paz-Oruro-Cochabamba lawmakers associated with Pando's Liberal Party introduced a motion calling for the official transfer of the seat of Government to La Paz, legalizing what had in fact been customary practice for decades. When this motion was prevented from being voted on by the Conservatives, the Liberal congressmen left Sucre and established themselves permanently in La Paz. At this point President Fernández himself led an army to La Paz, in order to ""restore order."" The ensuing bloodbath culminated in the crushing defeat of the Conservatives at the hands of General Pando, who emerged triumphant from the Battle of the Second Crucero, even taking President Fernández prisoner. Subsequently, Fernández was allowed to go into exile in Chile, but returned to Bolivia in his declining years, where he died in August 1925, a few days before his 76th birthday.","All of this changed radically with the emergence of a new, and very polarizing, wedge issue: the simmering displeasure in the cities of Sucre and Potosi, dating back to the days of President Andrés de Santa Cruz (1829–39), regarding the de facto takeover by the city of La Paz as the seat of the Bolivian government.","All of this changed radically with the emergence of a new, and very polarizing, wedge issue: the simmering displeasure in the cities of Sucre and Potosi, dating back to the days of President Andrés de Santa Cruz (1829–39), regarding the de facto takeover by the city of La Paz as the seat of the Bolivian government.",,

The planets of the Solar System can only be observed in their current state, but observations of different planetary systems of varying ages allows us to observe planets at different stages of evolution. Available observations range from young proto-planetary disks where planets are still forming to planetary systems of over 10 Gyr old. When planets form in a gaseous protoplanetary disk, they accrete hydrogen/helium envelopes. These The hydrogen / helium envelopes cool and contract over time and , depending on the mass of the planet , some or all of the hydrogen / helium is eventually lost to space . This means that even terrestrial planets may start off with large radii if they form early enough.

It The Boston Water and Sewer Commission was created in 1977 taking control of the city operated sewer system and the state operated treatment facilities . The basic Boston water distribution system opened in 1848, and the wastewater collection system in 1883. In a response to the dangers posed to Boston by severely deteriorated water distribution and wastewater collection systems, BWSC was created in 1977 by an act of the Massachusetts legislature as a public instrument, a corporate separate and apart from the City of Boston. The Enabling Act empowered the BWSC to independently set rates and charges for the water distribution and wastewater collection services it provides and entrusted BWSC to improve and maintain the integrity of its systems. BWSC purchases water from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), a wholesale supplier of water and wastewater services. MWRA collect water in the Quabbin Reservoir, connected by a 65 miles (105 km) tunnel to Boston, and enters BWSC distribution system at 27 metered sites. When full, the Quabbin Reservoir holds 412 billion US gallons (1.56×109 m3), making it one of the largest man-made public water supplies in the country. In the 40 years since its creation, BWSC has relaid or relined over 300 miles (480 km) of aging, and claims to have reduced the amount of water being lost through system leaks by 50 million US gallons (190,000 m3) per day. It has also, in conjunction with the MWRA, eliminated 81 miles (130 km) of combined sewer overflows to Boston Harbor.

After the driver goes for help, Dougal accidentally crashes the cart into the magic roundabout at the centre of the village. Zeebad, the evil blue ice jack in the box-like creature, emerges from the top and flies away, followed by a Foot Guard figurine thrown off the roundabout. The roundabout freezes over, trapping repairman Mr Rusty, Dougal's young owner Florence, and two other children named Coral and Basil within an icy cell. The horrified villagers, who are all animals, call upon Zebedee for help. He explains that the roundabout was a mystical prison for Zeebad. With it broken, Zeebad is free to work his magic on the world again as he once did before by starting the Ice Age. The only way to stop Zeebad freezing the world is by collecting three magic diamonds (one of which is supposed to be hidden on the roundabout, while the other two are hidden at separate locations far beyond the village). Slotting the diamonds onto the roundabout will re-imprison Zeebad and undo his magic, but if Zeebad retrieves them first then their power will allow him to freeze the Sun itself.

Some of the earliest titles include kniaz and velikiy kniaz, which mean ""prince"" and ""grand prince"" respectively but are often rendered as ""duke"" and ""grand duke"" in Western literature; then the title of tsar, meaning ""caesar"", which was disputed to be the equal of either a king or emperor; finally culminating in the title of emperor.

done,"Lloyd Percival [HEAD] Biography [SEP] Percival then became a coach for the Toronto Native Sons, a junior ice hockey team, during the 1939–40 season. He worked with hockey players as their fitness coach, including Gordie Howe and Terry Sawchuk, and also worked with professional golfer George Knudson, for whom he devised extensive workout programs. Sandra Bezic, George Chuvalo and Kathy Kreiner are among the other athletes trained by Percival. In addition, he became a leading track and field coach in Canada, a position he maintained into the 1960s, having founded the North Toronto Red Devils club in 1946. With athletes on the Red Devils, Percival introduced interval training and worked with them on strength development. At the time, these were new approaches for Canada, despite having been used in European nations. In addition, he advocated for training measures that did not involve running, such as diet improvements and the use of massages. Isometric exercise was a form of workout favored by Percival, along with mental training; The Globe and Mail's Lorne Rubenstein wrote that ""he wanted the mind and body allied as one under the objective of getting the most out of oneself."" Along with his coaching, Percival branched out into other pursuits related to sport. On the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) radio network, he hosted a program called The Sports College on the Air, which at one point attracted listening audiences of 800,000 people. The program first aired in the early 1940s on the CKOC radio station in Hamilton, before the CBC began running it in 1944. Percival authored various works that gave advice on proper sporting technique, in sports including basketball, ice hockey, and volleyball, along with more general fitness guides. In 1951, Percival wrote the book The Hockey Handbook. According to sportswriter Tim Wharnsby, this work became influential in the world of ice hockey. Anatoly Tarasov, an early coach of the Soviet Union national ice hockey team, used The Hockey Handbook as a training tool in developing the country's hockey program, according to Wharnsby. In addition, the national teams of Czechoslovakia, Finland, and Sweden were said to have used Percival's book to aid in player development. Writers Tobias Stark and Hart Cantelon credit the book as having a more modest impact on Soviet hockey development, saying that the noticed version was a 1957 edition that came from Czechoslovakia; according to them, the book was noted in Sweden at the time of its first release. Regardless, National Hockey League (NHL) teams largely ignored Percival's work for most of his career. His only involvement with an NHL club was with the Detroit Red Wings, for whom he ran players through workouts and interviewed them in 1950. Author Gary Mossman wrote that ""Percival was never released from the purgatory to which NHL coaches and officials relegated him for daring to challenge their knowledge of the game."" Toronto Maple Leafs head coach Hap Day was among those sharply critical of Percival. The sports media also criticized Percival; one sportswriter later reported that ""his ideas were too radical and comprehensive, not just for those they were designed for but also for those who report."" An athletic complex designed by Percival called the Fitness Institute opened in 1963. It featured facilities to train athletes in several sports as well as computerized equipment. Members of the complex were each given individualized programs to aid their progress. By the early 1970s, Percival began to receive greater recognition; the Canadian Olympic Association hired him as a consultant. Percival died in 1974 in Toronto.

un,"Kingdom of Bavaria [HEAD] History ; Ludwig I, Maximilian II and the Revolutions [SEP] In 1825, Ludwig I ascended the throne of Bavaria. Under Ludwig, the arts flourished in Bavaria, and Ludwig personally ordered and financially assisted the creation of many neoclassical buildings and architecture across Bavaria. Ludwig also increased Bavaria's pace towards industrialization under his reign. In foreign affairs under Ludwig's rule, Bavaria supported the Greeks during the Greek War of Independence with his second son, Otto being elected King of Greece in 1832. As for politics, initial reforms advocated by Ludwig were both liberal and reform-oriented. However, after the Revolutions of 1830, Ludwig turned to conservative reaction. The Hambacher Fest in 1832 showed the discontent of the population with high taxes and censorship. Bavaria joined the Zollverein in 1834. In 1835, the first German railway was constructed in Bavaria, between the cities of Fürth and Nuremberg. In 1837, the Roman Catholic-supported clerical movement, the Ultramontanes, came to power in the Bavarian parliament and began a campaign of reform to the constitution, which removed civil rights that had earlier been granted to Protestants, as well as enforcing censorship and forbidding the free discussion of internal politics. This regime was short-lived due to the demand by the Ultramontanes of the naturalization of Ludwig I's Irish mistress, Lola Montez, a notorious courtesan and dancer, which was resented by Ludwig, and the Ultramontanes were pushed out. During the Revolutions of 1848, Ludwig abdicated on 20 March 1848 in favour of his eldest son, Maximilian II. The revolutions also brought amendments to the constitution, including changes to the lower house of the Landtag with equal suffrage for every male who paid a direct tax. Maximilian II responded to the demands of the people for a united German state by attending the Frankfurt Assembly, which intended to create such a state. However, when Maximilian II rejected the Frankfurt Constitution in 1849, there was an uprising in the Bavarian Palatinate under Joseph Martin Reichard, which was put down with the support of Prussian forces. However Maximilian II stood alongside Bavaria's ally, the Austrian Empire, in opposition to Austria's enemy, the Kingdom of Prussia. This position was resented by many Bavarian citizens, who wanted a united Germany. In the end Prussia declined the crown offered by the Frankfurt Assembly as the proposed constitution of a German state was perceived to be too liberal and not in Prussia ' s interests . In the aftermath of the failure of the Frankfurt Assembly, Prussia and Austria continued to debate over which monarchy had the inherent right to rule Germany. A dispute between Austria and the Prince of Hesse-Kassel was used by Austria and its allies (including Bavaria) to promote the isolation of Prussia in German political affairs. This diplomatic insult almost led to war when Austria, Bavaria, and other allies moved troops through Bavaria towards Hesse-Kassel in 1850. However, Prussia backed down to Austria, and accepted of dual leadership. This event was known as the Punctation of Olmütz but also known as the ""Humiliation of Olmütz"" by Prussia. This event solidified the Bavarian kingdom's alliance with Austria against Prussia. When the project to unite the German middle-sized powers under Bavarian leadership against Prussia and Austria (the so-called Trias) failed, Minister-President Von der Pfordten resigned in 1859. Attempts by Prussia to reorganize the loose and un-led German Confederation were opposed by Bavaria and Austria, with Bavaria taking part in its own discussions with Austria and other allies in 1863, in Frankfurt, without Prussia and its allies attending.",In the end Prussia declined the crown offered by the Frankfurt Assembly as the proposed constitution of a German state was perceived to be too liberal and not in Prussia's interests.,In the end Prussia declined the crown offered by the Frankfurt Assembly as the proposed constitution of a German state was perceived to be too liberal and not in Prussia's interests.,,
imp,"Userkaf [HEAD] Sun temple ; Significance [SEP] Userkaf is the first pharaoh to build a dedicated temple to the sun god Ra in the Memphite necropolis north of Abusir, on a promontory on the desert edge just south of the modern locality of Abu Gurab. Works might have started during Userkaf's fifth or sixth year of reign. The only plausible precedent for Userkaf's sun temple was the temple associated with the Great Sphinx of Giza, which may have been dedicated to Ra and may thus have served similar purposes. In any case, Userkaf's successors for the next 80 years followed his course of action: sun temples were built by all subsequent Fifth Dynasty pharaohs until Menkauhor Kaiu, with the possible exception of Shepseskare, whose reign might have been too short to build one. Userkaf's choice of Abusir as the site of his sun temple has not been satisfactorily explained, the site being of no particular significance up to that point. Userkaf's choice may have influenced subsequent kings of the Fifth Dynasty who made Abusir the royal necropolis until the reign of Menkauhor Kaiu. For the Egyptologist Hans Goedicke, Userkaf's decision to build a temple for the setting sun separated from his own mortuary complex is a manifestation of and response to sociopolitical tensions, if not turmoil, at the end of the Fourth Dynasty. The construction of the sun temple permitted a distinction between the king's personal afterlife and religious issues pertaining to the setting sun, which had been so closely intertwined in the pyramid complexes of Giza and in the pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty. Thus, Userkaf's pyramid would be isolated in Saqqara, not even surrounded by a wider cemetery for his contemporaries, while the sun temple would serve the social need for a solar cult, which, while represented by the king, would not be exclusively embodied by him anymore. Malek similarly sees the construction of sun temples as marking a shift from the royal cult, which was so preponderant during the early Fourth Dynasty, to the cult of the sun god Ra. A result of these changes is that the king was now primarily revered as the son of Ra .

On the night of the assassination, Seward was at his home in Lafayette Park, confined to bed and recovering from injuries sustained April 5 from being thrown from his carriage. Herold guided Powell to Seward's house. Powell carried an 1858 Whitney revolver (a large, heavy, and popular gun during the Civil War) and a Bowie knife. William Bell, Seward's maître d’, answered the door when Powell knocked 10:10 pm, as Booth made his way to the Presidential Box at Ford's Theater. Powell told Bell that he had medicine from Seward's physician and that his instructions were to personally show Seward how to take it. Overcoming Bell's skepticism, Powell made his way up the stairs to Seward's third-floor bedroom. At the top of the staircase he was stopped by Seward's son, Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward, to whom he repeated the medicine story; Frederick, suspicious, said his father was asleep. Hearing voices, Seward's daughter Fanny emerged from Seward's room and said, ""Fred, Father is awake now"" – thus revealing to Powell where Seward was. Powell turned as if to start downstairs but suddenly turned again and drew his revolver . He aimed at Frederick's forehead and pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired, so he bludgeoned Frederick unconscious with it. Bell, yelling ""Murder! Murder! "", ran outside for help. Fanny opened the door again, and Powell shoved past her to Seward's bed. He stabbed at Seward's face and neck, slicing open his cheek.

done,"History of Transcendental Meditation [HEAD] 1960s [SEP] In 1960, the Maharishi founded the International Meditation Society (IMS) and trained his first TM teacher, Henry Nyburg of England. During the tour Maharishi made Henry Nyburg his personal representative in Europe and gave him the training and authority to teach Transcendental Meditation, thus making him the first European teacher. On 13 March 1961, a meeting called ""1961 World Congress"" was organised for the Maharishi in the Royal Albert Hall by Leon MacLaren of The School of Economic Science and Dr Frances Roles of the Study Society. Two smaller meetings were held at Caxton Hall prior to the main event.The Royal Albert Hall meeting was attended by 5,000 people. The School of Economic Science was instrumental in promoting TM in the UK from the 1960s. In collaboration with The Study Society and the School of Economic Science, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi established The School of Meditation in London in 1961, under the direction of Bill Whiting its purpose was, and remains, to study and teach the principles and practical application of meditation. Many of the subsequent leaders of The School of Meditation were students of the Maharishi. The School of Meditation is now an independent, self-governing organisation. By 2011, SoM had initiated 15,332 people into the practice of meditation, it has branches in several parts of the UK as well as in Greece and Holland. The Maharishi lectured at Caxton Hall in London and the talk was attended by Leon MacLaren. In the 1950s, he first TM teacher in the U.S. was a who was joined by a male instructor in 1966. The first international Teacher Training Course (TTC) was held near Rishikesh, India, in 1961, to train teachers of Transcendental Meditation. Over 60 meditators from India, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Britain, Malaya, Norway, the United States, Australia, Greece, Italy and the West Indies attended the course. Teachers continued to be trained as time progressed and by 1978, there were 7,000 TM teachers in the U.S alone. The Maharishi appeared on BBC television and gave a lecture to 5,000 people at the Royal Albert Hall in London in 1974. According to a history written by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 21 members of the Indian Parliament issued a public statement endorsing TM in 1963. According to the Maharishi, news articles on the technique appeared in Canadian newspapers such as the Daily Colonist, Calgary Herald, and The Albertan. The Students International Meditation Society (SIMS) began in Germany in 1964, was incorporated in the USA in 1965 and continues to function in some countries. Another organization, the American Foundation for the Science of Creative Intelligence (AFSC) taught TM to business people at Connecticut General Life Insurance Co., General Foods, Blue Cross/Blue Shield and AT&T. In 1967, the TM movement ""really took off"" when the Maharishi became the ""spiritual advisor to The Beatles"".

imp,"Sensorineural hearing loss [HEAD] Pathophysiology ; Cochlear dead regions in sensory hearing loss ; Cochlear hair cells [SEP] Outer hair cells (OHCs) contribute to the structure of the Organ of Corti, which is situated between the basilar membrane and the tectorial membrane within the cochlea (See Figure 3). The tunnel of corti, which runs through the Organ of Corti, divides the OHCs and the inner hair cells (IHCs). OHCs are connected to the reticular laminar and the Deiters’ cells. There are roughly twelve thousand OHCs in each human ear, and these are arranged in up to five rows. Each OHC has small tufts of 'hairs', or cilia, on their upper surface known as stereocilia, and these are also arranged into rows which are graded in height. There are approximately 140 stereocilia on each OHC. The fundamental role of the OHCs and the IHCs is to function as sensory receptors. The main function of the IHCs is to transmit sound information via afferent neurons. They do this by transducing mechanical movements or signals into neural activity. When stimulated, the stereocilia on the IHCs move, causing a flow of electric current to pass through the hair cells. This electric current creates action potentials within the connected afferent neurons. OHCs are different in that they actually contribute to the active mechanism of the cochlea. They do this by receiving mechanical signals or vibrations along the basilar membrane, and transducing them into electrochemical signals. The stereocilia found on OHCs are in contact with the tectorial membrane. Therefore, when the basilar membrane moves due to vibrations, the stereocilia bend. The direction in which they bend, dictates the firing rate of the auditory neurons connected to the OHCs. The bending of the stereocilia towards the basal body of the OHC causes excitation of the hair cell. Thus, an increase in firing rate of the auditory neurons connected to the hair cell occurs. On the other hand , the bending of the stereocilia away from the basal body of the OHC causes inhibition of the hair cell . Thus, a decrease in firing rate of the auditory neurons connected to the hair cell occurs. OHCs are unique in that they are able to contract and expand (electromotility). Therefore, in response to the electrical stimulations provided by the efferent nerve supply, they can alter in length, shape and stiffness. These changes influence the response of the basilar membrane to sound. It is therefore clear that the OHCs play a major role in the active processes of the cochlea. The main function of the active mechanism is to finely tune the basilar membrane, and provide it with a high sensitivity to quiet sounds. The active mechanism is dependent on the cochlea being in good physiological condition. However, the cochlea is very susceptible to damage.","On the other hand, the bending of the stereocilia away from the basal body of the OHC causes inhibition of the hair cell.","On the other hand, the bending of the stereocilia away from the basal body of the OHC causes inhibition of the hair cell.",,

un,"Royalty payment [HEAD] Music ; Performance ; Conventional forms of royalty payment [SEP] In the conventional context, royalties are paid to composers and publishers and record labels for public performances of their music on vehicles such as the jukebox, stage, radio or TV. Users of music need to obtain a ""performing rights license"" from music societies – as will be explained shortly – to use the music. Performing rights extend both to live and recorded music played in such diverse areas as cafés , skating rinks , etc . Licensing is generally done by music societies called ""Performing Rights Organizations"" (PROs), some of which are government-approved or government-owned, to which the composer, the publisher, performer (in some cases) or the record label have subscribed. The diagram on the right titled ""The Performance Rights Complex"" shows the general sequences by which a song or a composition gets to be titled a ""performance"" and which brings royalties to songwriters/publishers, performing artists and record labels. How, and to whom, royalties are paid is different in the United States from what it is, for example, in the UK. Most countries have ""practices"" more in common with the UK than the US. In the United Kingdom there are three principal organizations: Who license music (to music-users) and act as royalty collection and distribution agencies for their members. These funds are distributed quarterly though there can be delays depending on what PRO is being used to collect on music royalties. If copyrights holder(s) want payment sooner they have an option to take out an advance against their royalties with their PRO though these are based around 100% recoupment. PPL issues performance licenses to all UK radio, TV and broadcast stations, as well as establishments who employ sound recordings (tapes, CDs), in entertaining the public. The licensing company collects and distributes royalties to the ""record label"" for the sound recording and to ""featured UK performers"" in the recording. Performers do not earn from sound recordings on video and film. PRS, which is now in alliance with MCPS, collects royalties from music-users and distributes them directly to ""song-writers"" and ""publishers"" whose works are performed live, on radio or on TV on a 50:50 basis. MCPS licenses music for broadcast in the range 3 to 5.25% of net advertising revenues. MCPS also collects and disburses mechanical royalties to writers and publishers in a manner similar to PRS. Although allied, they serve, for now, as separate organizations for membership. The next diagram shows the sequences in the licensing of performances and the royalty collection and distribution process in the UK. Every song or recording has a unique identity by which they are licensed and tracked. Details of songs or recordings are notified to the PROs directly, or through Catco, an electronic tracking system. It needs to be clarified that while blanket licenses are commonly issued to music-users, the latter are responsible for ""usage returns"" – the actual frequency of performances under the license – which then becomes the basis for the PRO to apportion royalties to writers, publishers, and record labels. (""DIY indies"" are ""do-it-yourself"" independent songwriters – and, often, the performers as well – who record and publish under their own labels). In the UK, music is licensed (and royalties paid on it) at the track level. There is also a separate organization in the UK called VPL, which is the collecting society set up by the record industry in 1984 to grant licenses to users of music videos, e.g. broadcasters, program-makers, video jukebox system suppliers. The licensing income collected from users is paid out to the society's members after administrative costs are deducted. There are different models for royalty collection in European countries. In some of them, mechanical and performing rights are administered jointly. SACEM (France), SABAM (Belgium), GEMA (Germany) and JASRAC (Japan) work that way.","Performing rights extend both to live and recorded music played in such diverse areas as cafés, skating rinks, etc.","Performing rights extend both to live and recorded music played in such diverse areas as cafés, skating rinks, etc.",,
imp,"Nicole Diar [HEAD] [SEP] Nicole Diar, born July 21, 1975, is an American woman convicted of the August 27, 2003 murder of her 4-year-old son, Jacob. Prosecutors argued that Diar suffocated her son and before setting the house on fire, though the exact cause of Jacob's death was never determined because his body was too badly burned. The jury sentenced her to death. In 2008, the Ohio Supreme Court upheld her conviction but overturned the sentence on the basis that the jury was not informed that a single vote could prevent her from receiving the death penalty. On June 3, 2010, she was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Nicole Diar was convicted in 2005 of charges she killed her 4-year-old son, Jacob Diar. Jacob Diar's burned remains were found inside of their house in Lorain, Ohio after a house fire that occurred in 2003. Nicole Diar was able to run out of the house to safety but her son was left inside. Diar claimed she tried to save her son from his upstairs bedroom but the smoke was too much. The officers that morning said Diar did not have any soot or smell strongly of smoke as she would if she had tried to save her son during the fire . Jacob's autopsy could not determine cause of death but did suggest that he died before the fire was started due to the lack of soot and evidence of smoke inhalation in his lungs. Judge Kosma Glavas sentenced Diar to the death penalty after it was suggested by the Ohio jury in October 2005. The Ohio Supreme Court overturned her death sentence in 2008 because the Jury was not told ahead of time that just one of them could have changed her death sentence by refusing to consider execution. Diar suggested a bargain to prosecutors where she agreed to spend her life in prison and avoid future legal challenges if her death sentence is overturned. Nicole Diar herself was a burn victim from the age of 4. She suffered burns when her nightgown caught fire and ended up going through a total of 61 surgeries until she was 18. From this, she continued to receive a lump sum every month of $3,000 from a lawsuit against the pajama company. Diar would often leave Jacob at home with young, teen babysitters so she could go out to bars and parties for the night. One babysitter, Luis Agosto, recalls being told to give Jacob a ""medicine for his hyperactivity"" so he would get tired and go to sleep decently early. Agosto didn't question it and gave Jacob and his cousin, daughter of Rebecca Diar, Taylor. The two friends of Agosto who were also there that night read the label and pointed out that the medication he gave to the children was Tylenol 3 with codeine prescribed to Taylor. When they informed Diar of this incident, she brushed it off and said Jacob would be okay. Destiny Faulkner also babysat Jacob and could also recall being told to give Jacob this medicine on multiple occasions during the summer of 2003. Faulkner only gave Jacob the medication twice when told but did not on the last time because he was not ill. A pharmacist at the trial confirmed that it was a prescription for Taylor Diar of acetaminophen with codeine.

un,"Eliyahu Ben-Elissar [HEAD] Biography [SEP] Born Eli Gottlieb in Radom in Poland in 1932, Ben-Elissar was the son of a distinguished family. His parents were Eliezer and Hela (née Dobrzynska) Gottlieb. Eliezer and his brother, Jacob, owned and operated Brago, a successful foundry. Eli was the youngest of three siblings. The eldest, a sister Diana, was born on 7 August 1923, and a brother, Nathan, was born on 21 November 1925. Ten-year-old Gottlieb immigrated to Mandate Palestine in 1942 with some members of a Radomer family named Graucher using a visa originally obtained for a son who had already been deported by the Nazis. Ironically, the name of the child who perished so that Eli would survive was named Natan Chaim (Hebrew for ""he gave life""). Gottlieb attended the Bilu School in Tel Aviv joined the Irgun, and served in the IDF until 1965. He subsequently graduated from the University of Paris with a BA in Social Sciences and an MA in International Law and later studied for a PhD at the University of Geneva. Being in Palestine during the latter years of the Holocaust, Ben-Elissar did not know the fate of his family until the war's end in 1945. With his father's death in the Flossenbürg concentration camp, and his mother's demise due to a tragic road accident in Germany after the war, Ben-Elissar was orphaned at the age of 14. The effects of the Holocaust were always of great and enduring significance in his life. In 1947, Ben Elissar's sister, Diana, immigrated to the United States with her new husband, Moshe (Murray) Weinstock. Raising three children, Leo, Allen, and Elaine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Diana remained a steadfast fixture in Ben-Elissar's life. His brother, Nathan, served in the IDF during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, studied in Vienna, and emigrated to the United States in 1967 where he served as a cantor for many years. Nathan married Rochelle Kelman, and they had a daughter, Nechama. Ben - Elissar married Diana ( née Dudel ) , and his second wife was Nitza ( née Efroni ) . After receiving his doctorate, Ben Elissar became a journalist and then a spokesman for the Herut party. He was appointed Director-General of the Prime Minister's Office of Menachem Begin in 1977, a position he held until 1980 when he was appointed as Israel's first ambassador to Egypt following the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. In 1981 he left his ambassadorial post, and was elected to the Knesset on the Likud list. During his first Knesset term he chaired the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. He was re-elected in 1984, 1988, 1992 and 1996, and again chaired the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee between 1988 and 1992. Four months after the 1996 elections he left the Knesset to become ambassador to the United States. In 1998, he was appointed ambassador to France. He authored several books in Hebrew and in French.

Ekström won the 1999 championship driving an Audi A4 quattro. He switched rides again in 2000, finishing third with a factory Volvo S40. In 2001, Ekström joined the Abt Junior team to compete at the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters. Driving Audi TT, he finished 8th in his debut season, third in 2002, and fourth in 2003. In 2004, Ekström won the 2004 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, defeating Mercedes rivals Gary Paffett and Christijan Albers. In the 2005 DTM season he finished second behind Paffett. Ekström has also been active in rallying and the World Rally Championship. He debuted in the WRC in 1999 and recorded his best result at the 2005 Swedish Rally, finishing tenth in a Škoda factory team Fabia WRC. At the 2005 Race of Champions, Ekström won the Nations' Cup with Tom Kristensen. In 2006, he won the Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy and earned the title Champion of Champions at the 2006 Race of Champions, by winning over Sébastien Loeb in the individual event finals. After a poor 2006 season, Ekström won his second DTM title in 2007 and went on to win the 2007 Race of Champions, beating Michael Schumacher in the individual finals. In 2009, he won the Race of Champions once more beating the seven-time world champion in the final. Mattias Ekström became the first Scandinavian driver to take part in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series in June 2010 . He raced for Team Red Bull at Infineon Raceway, substituting for Brian Vickers in the No. 83 Toyota Camry, as Vickers was inactive for the remainder of the 2010 season due to blood clots. Ekström was able to finish 21st and lead 7 laps mostly remaining in the top 5 or top 10 the whole day. However he did so ex-aequo with another Scandinavian driver as Jan Magnussen from Denmark also took part in the same race, eventually finishing ahead of Ekström. Ekström also ran the Air Guard 400 at Richmond International Raceway where he started 42nd and finished 31st.

un,"Breast cancer [HEAD] Signs and symptoms [SEP] Breast cancer most commonly presents as a lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of cases are discovered when a person detects such a lump with the fingertips. The earliest breast cancers, however, are detected by a mammogram. Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits may also indicate breast cancer. Indications of breast cancer other than a lump may include thickening different from the other breast tissue, one breast becoming larger or lower, a nipple changing position or shape or becoming inverted, skin puckering or dimpling, a rash on or around a nipple, discharge from nipple/s, constant pain in part of the breast or armpit and swelling beneath the armpit or around the collarbone. Pain (""mastodynia"") is an unreliable tool in determining the presence or absence of breast cancer, but may be indicative of other breast health issues. Another symptom complex of breast cancer is Paget's disease of the breast. This syndrome presents as skin changes resembling eczema; such as redness, discoloration or mild flaking of the nipple skin. As Paget's disease of the breast advances, symptoms may include tingling, itching, increased sensitivity, burning, and pain. There may also be discharge from the nipple. Approximately half the women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the breast also have a lump in the breast. Inflammatory Breast Cancer presents with similar effects . Inflammatory Breast Cancer is a rare (only seen in less than 5% of breast cancer diagnosis) yet aggressive form of breast cancer characterized by the swollen, red areas formed on the top of the Breast. The visual effects of Inflammatory Breast Cancer is a result of a blockage of lymph vessels by cancer cells. This type of breast cancer is seen in more commonly diagnosed in younger ages, obese women and African American women. As inflammatory breast cancer does not present as a lump there can sometimes be a delay in diagnosis. In rare cases, what initially appears as a fibroadenoma (hard, movable non-cancerous lump) could in fact be a phyllodes tumor. Phyllodes tumors are formed within the stroma (connective tissue) of the breast and contain glandular as well as stromal tissue. Phyllodes tumors are not staged in the usual sense; they are classified on the basis of their appearance under the microscope as benign, borderline or malignant. Malignant tumors can result in metastatic tumors— secondary tumors (originating from the primary tumor) that spread beyond the site of origination. The symptoms caused by metastatic breast cancer will depend on the location of metastasis. Common sites of metastasis include bone, liver, lung, and brain. When cancer has reached such an invasive state, it is categorized as a stage 4 cancer, cancers of this state are oftentimes fatal. Common symptoms of stage 4 cancer include unexplained weight loss, bone and joint pain, jaundice and neurological symptoms. These symptoms are called non-specific symptoms because they could be manifestations of many other illnesses. Rarely breast cancer can spread to exceedingly uncommon sites such as peripancreatic lymph nodes causing biliary obstruction leading to diagnostic difficulties. Most symptoms of breast disorders, including most lumps, do not turn out to represent underlying breast cancer. Less than 20% of lumps, for example, are cancerous, and benign breast diseases such as mastitis and fibroadenoma of the breast are more common causes of breast disorder symptoms.",Inflammatory Breast Cancer presents with similar effects.,Inflammatory Breast Cancer presents with similar effects.,,

However, according to Nava-sahasanka-charita and epigraphic evidence, Munja was succeeded by his brother (and Bhoja's father) Sindhuraja. Merutunga mentions a legend about Munja's attempt to kill a young Bhoja. The legend is also repeated by Ballala with some variations. It states that an astrologer predicted the future greatness of Bhoja as a king. According to Merutunga's version, Munja wanted his own son to become the king. According to Ballala's account, Munja did not want Bhoja to surpass his glory. Both accounts state that the person ordered to carry out the execution faked the killing. Before his faked death, Bhoja wrote a message for Munja, upon reading which Munja felt great remorse. When he came to know that Bhoja was still alive, Munja appointed him as his heir. This legend is considered of spurious nature by the historians. Munja's court poet Dhanapala states that the king had great love for Bhoja. Merutunga and Ballala are later writers, and their accounts are not historically reliable. Moreover, historical evidence indicates that Munja's successor was Sindhuraja, not Bhoja. The contemporary writers Padmagupta and Dhanapala state that Munja died childless. Merutunga states that the king had one son. Ballala states that he Munja had multiple sons . D. C. Ganguly theorized that Munja had two sons, Aranyaraja and Chandana; he appointed these as the administrators of Abu and Jalor. A Paramara branch at Jalor is known to have been founded by one Vakpati-raja. According to Chandana, this person is same as the Vakpati Munja. Seth speculates that Munja had only one son, Chandana, whom he appointed as the ruler of Jalor. Pratipala Bhatia rejects these theories, stating that Aranyaraja lived two generations before Munja, and there is no concrete evidence about Chandana being Munja's son either. The fact that Munja was succeeded by his brother Sindhuraja also indicates that he died without any heir. Another possibility is that Munja did not expect to die in his expedition against the Chalukyas. Therefore, he left the administration in hands of his brother Sindhuraja temporarily. His unexpected death left Sindhuraja as the king, and then the throne passed on to Sindhuraja's son Bhoja.",Ballala states that he had multiple sons.,Ballala states that Munja had multiple sons.,y,

done,"Heterobasidion occidentale [HEAD] Symptoms, and Signs [SEP] H. occidentale can be detected in stands due to lower crown height of affected trees in a stand. Infection weakens the roots and will travel up to 15 meters (49 ft) up the heartwood affecting wood quality and yield. The weakened roots will increase the chance of windthrow, which can be used to identify diseased sites. The hosts of H. occidentale tend to have increased butt and sapwood decay then H. irregulare hosts which suffer from cambial and sapwood necrosis. Affected trees can be hard to identify as older trees tend to show gradual symptoms such as decreased leader growth, abnormally short twigs or needles, as well as decreased root systems. The fruit bodies (basidiocarps) of H. occidentale are its most identifying feature. It is a small shelf or ""conk"" with an irregular edge with white spore tubes on the underneath. The basidiocarp is perennial and the top layer will form layering edges that are dark yellow to brown. Basidiocarps tend to form near the forest floor of affected trees and may be hidden in the forest duff. Identification in affected wood, known as white pocket rot, includes symptoms in the form of dark discolouration around the heartwood near the base. Heavily diseased wood will be soft, stringy, and fibrous that may contain black specks parallel to the grain. Quick identification of affected wood can be done by wrapping suspect wood in damp paper towels and left for 5–6 days for the tell-tale formation of the conidial anamorph, Spiniger meineckellus. The basidiospores are spherical to ellipsoid, distinctive of the family Bondarzewiaceae. Distinction from H. irregulare is difficult as both share similar morphologies, distribution, and host range. In stands were both species are endemic, differentiation by hosts is unreliable due to shared host species and the potential spread from root contacts from other host species. Identification using genetic methods is the most accurate method for differentiation of Heterobasidion occidentale . Morphologically differentiation is most reliably made through pore density of the basidiocarps as H. irregulare has a lower density than H. occidentale with more oblong and larger pores.

The publication featured prominent figures such as Adrienne Rich, Eve Merriam, Marge Piercy, Rochelle Owens, and Audre Lorde.

Those differences which have characterized women's writing in traditional modes have often been either ignored or erased as defects or failures, rather than understood as distinctive values.

From these trips, Bob had developed an interest in programing. In 1953 as he was driving back from Chicago to Madison, Wisconsin in 1953 he imagined creating a children's program. Bob recognized that giants were usually portrayed as frightening. It was his wife, Esther, who came up with the idea of a ""friendly giant.""

done,"Criticism of Christianity [HEAD] Doctrine ; Atonement [SEP] The idea of atonement for sin is criticized by Richard Dawkins on the grounds that the image of God as requiring the suffering and death of Jesus to effect reconciliation with humankind is immoral. The view is summarized by Dawkins: ""if God wanted to forgive our sins, why not just forgive them? Who is God trying to impress ? "" Oxford theologian Alister McGrath maintains that Richard Dawkins is "" ignorant "" of Christian theology , and therefore unable to engage religion and faith intelligently . He goes on to say that the atonement was necessary because of our flawed human nature, which made it impossible for us to save ourselves, and that it expresses God's love for us by removing the sin that stands in the way of our reconciliation with God. Responding to the criticism that he is ""ignorant"" of theology, Dawkins asks, ""Do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in leprechauns?"" and ""[y]es, I have, of course, met this point before. It sounds superficially fair. But it presupposes that there is something in Christian theology to be ignorant about. The entire thrust of my position is that Christian theology is a non-subject."" Dinesh D'Souza says that Dawkins' criticism ""only makes sense if you assume Christians made the whole thing up."" He goes on to say that Christians view it as a beautiful sacrifice, and that ""through the extremity of Golgotha, Christ reconciles divine justice and divine mercy."" Andrew Wilson argues that Dawkins misses the point of the atonement, which has nothing to do with masochism, but is based on the concepts of holiness, sin and grace. Robert Green Ingersoll suggests that the concept of the atonement is simply an extension of the Mosaic tradition of blood sacrifice and ""is the enemy of morality"". The death of Jesus Christ represents the blood sacrifice to end all blood sacrifices; the resulting mechanism of atonement by proxy through that final sacrifice has appeal as a more convenient and much less costly approach to redemption than repeated animal sacrifice—a common sense solution to the problem of reinterpreting ancient religious approaches based on sacrifice. The prominent Christian apologist Josh McDowell, in More Than A Carpenter, addresses the issue through an analogy of a real-life judge in California who was forced to fine his daughter $100 for speeding, but then came down, took off his robe, and paid the fine for her from his billfold, though as in this and other cases, illustrations are only cautiously intended to describe certain aspects of the atonement.","Who is God trying to impress?""

In 1136–1142 Ali bin Mahdi propagated his religious ideas in the Tihama lowland which at that time was ruled by the Najahids of Zabid. The Najahid queen 'Alam was initially attracted by his teachings and even exempted him and his followers from paying the kharaj. Building up a power base, he gathered an army in 1143 and attacked his benefactors. He made efforts to conquer the town al-Kadrā north of Zabid. This, however, failed. Ali and his followers withdrew to the mountains but were allowed back to the Najahid realm in 1146 at the insistence of queen 'Alam.

Since 2005 the HANS Device (Head and Neck Support Device) has been the only such approved device. Since 2003, helmets have been required for pit crew members as well. Drivers and pit crew members must also wear firesuits. Drivers are required to use carbon fiber seats and headrests for strength and durability. Cars have also been redesigned since the 2001 death of Dale Earnhardt and after spectacular crashes to reflect new discoveries and developments in safety. All oval tracks in any of NASCAR ' s National Series ( except on dirt races , such as at Eldora ) use the SAFER Barrier and other soft wall technology to lessen impacts . After a series of flips and dangerous crashes in the 1980s, NASCAR began requiring all cars to run a restrictor plate at Daytona and Talladega. The restrictor plate limits air into the engine, reducing horsepower and speed at these tracks from 230-240 mph to 195-200 mph. At these races, in addition to the restrictor plate, there are a variety of other technical rules and regulations to keep the cars stable and on the track. In addition to these technical rules, restrictor plate races and road courses are the only races where NASCAR enforces track limits. At the high-speed superspeedways, track limits are marked by a double yellow line separating the apron from the racing surface. Exceeding track limits to advance one's position is subject to a drive-through penalty, or if the foul occurs on the last lap that car will be relegated to the last car on the lead lap in official race results. The superspeedway track limits (often referred as the ""yellow line rule"") have been part of considerable criticism and controversies, such as when Regan Smith was stripped of second-place finish at the 2008 AMP Energy 500 following a last-lap pass attempt that went below the line and controversies surrounding the finish of the 2020 YellaWood 500, with former drivers turned television coverage pundits Dale Jarrett and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. (the latter being involved in a track limits controversy at the 2003 Aaron's 499) calling for the repeal of the rule.

done,"William Henry Harrison 1840 presidential campaign [HEAD] Campaign ; Hard cider and log cabins (December 1839 to March 1840) [SEP] Harrison accepted his nomination in a letter dated December 19, 1839. At age 66 then (67 by the election), he was the oldest presidential candidate to that point. He pledged to serve only one term, but was vague about other stances, writing that his public career made stating his positions unnecessary. There was no party platform; most Whigs did not favor binding candidates to a legislative plan. If the Whigs did not leave Harrisburg completely united, they achieved this within weeks of the convention. A testimonial dinner to Senator Clay in Washington on December 11, attended by convention delegates and other politicians, healed many wounds, and a series of huge public meetings, held to ratify the nominations of Harrison and Tyler, showed the Whigs willing to put the nomination fight behind them. The Democratic press was unimpressed by Harrison's nomination, and attacked him for not publishing his views on the main issues of the day, dubbing him ""General Mum"". The New York Herald mocked the aging general, ""Mrs. Harrison of Ohio is undoubtedly a very excellent matron for her time, but if we must take a woman president, let's have youth and beauty, and not age and imbecility."" John de Ziska, Washington correspondent for the Baltimore Republican (a Democratic paper) who wrote under the initial Z, alleged that one particularly embittered Clayite had wondered how to ""get rid of"" Harrison, and the paper printed Z's suggestion: ""Give him a barrel of hard cider, and settle a pension of two thousand a year on him, and my word for it, he will sit the remainder of his days in his log cabin by the side of a 'sea coal' fire, and study moral philosophy."" This gibe was quickly reprinted by other Democratic papers. The taunt hit home in an America where the log cabin was seen as part of the national heritage; though relatively few lived in one by 1840, many had resided in one earlier in life, or had parents who had. Alexis de Tocqueville , the French diplomat who toured America in the 1830s , chronicled them log cabins as the pioneer ' s first dwelling . Hard cider was seen as a drink of the common man. The Whigs decided to take pride in the cabin and cider the Democrats had derided. The origins of how this came to be are uncertain, though the most commonly rendered version of events has, in January 1840, Pennsylvania Whig operative Thomas Elder coming up with the idea of making log cabins a symbol of the Harrison/Tyler campaign. Robert Gray Gunderson, in his account of the 1840 election, described how one was displayed at a Harrisburg ratification meeting on January 20, and ""within the month, cabins, [rac]coons, and cider became symbols of resurgent Whiggery."" John Gasaway, in his doctoral thesis on communications in the 1840 campaign, noted that Harrison was called the ""log cabin and hard cider candidate"" in one paper as early as December 20, 1839, and that images of Harrison and humble abodes he was deemed to have protected date as far back as the War of 1812.","Alexis de Tocqueville, the French diplomat who toured America in the 1830s, chronicled them as the pioneer's first dwelling.","Alexis de Tocqueville, the French diplomat who toured America in the 1830s, chronicled log cabins as the pioneer's first dwelling.",y,

His ethics have been under scrutiny for alleged manipulation of these recordings in order to make subjects appear guilty of some wrongdoing. Hunter S. Thompson was known for his undercover work reporting on the California-based motorcycle gang, the Hells Angels. His book, Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs, profiles the gang as Thompson spent roughly a year embedded among the Angels, during a time when their notoriety was at an all-time high. Elizabeth Jane Cochran, writing under the pseudonym Nellie Bly, became known for her undercover work for the New York World, titled Ten Days in a Mad-House, when she checked herself into an insane asylum as a patient to report on cruelty and neglect. After ten days she was released and later went on to help a grand jury prosecute the mental ward. Gunter Wallraff is a German journalist known for his undercover work, Ganz unten (""The lowest of the low""), on exposing the oppressive conditions faced by the immigrant workforce in Germany. He sought employment in German factories, pharmaceutical companies, and a wide array of odd jobs for roughly two years before publishing the book. Anas Aremeyaw Anas is a Ghanaian investigative journalist born in the late 1970s. Anas is famous for utilizing his anonymity as a tool in his investigation arsenal (very few people have seen his face).A multimedia journalist who specializes in print media and documentary, Anas focuses on issues of human rights and anti-corruption in Ghana and sub-Saharan Africa. Anas has won critical acclaim for his work advocating for the right to not be held in human slavery or servitude and to have a standard of living in the event of an illness. His investigative works have won him worldwide acclaim with President Barack Obama highlighting his virtues in a speech during his 2009 visit to Ghana: ""An independent press. A vibrant private sector. A civil society. Those are the things that give life to democracy. We see that spirit in courageous journalists like Anas Aremeyaw Anas, who risked his life to report the truth. ""Anas has won over fourteen international awards for his investigative work.

un,"Chain Home Low [HEAD] Development ; AMES Type 11 [SEP] Although GCI began to supplant CHL during 1941 and especially 1942 , CHL continued to provide an important early warning role . In February 1942 the Germans mounted the Channel Dash, moving two of their battleships to harbours in Germany by sailing them right up the English Channel. This major embarrassment was due largely to supremely effective jamming on the part of the Germans, who managed to render the CH and CHL radars covering the coast entirely ineffective without the operators even noticing. To address this, the RAF began development of the AMES Type 11, a truck-mounted CHL system operating at 500–600 MHz. This frequency was chosen to match that of German anti-aircraft radars, in the hopes that the signals would be more difficult to notice, and that jamming would have negative effects on the German's own radars. Type 11's were deliberately used only in times of jamming in order to avoid giving the Germans signals intelligence about them, and in the end were little used.","Although GCI began to supplant CHL during 1941 and especially 1942, CHL continued to provide an important early warning role.","Although GCI began to supplant CHL during 1941 and especially 1942, CHL continued to provide an important early warning role.",,

un,"Radioactive decay [HEAD] Mathematics ; Universal law ; Chain-decay processes [SEP] Now consider the case of a chain of two decays: one nuclide A decaying into another B by one process, then B decaying into another C by a second process, i.e. A → B → C. The previous equation cannot be applied to the decay chain, but can be generalized as follows. Since A decays into B, then B decays into C, the activity of A adds to the total number of B nuclides in the present sample, before those B nuclides decay and reduce the number of nuclides leading to the later sample. In other words, the number of second generation nuclei B increases as a result of the first generation nuclei decay of A, and decreases as a result of its own decay into the third generation nuclei C. The sum of these two terms gives the law for a decay chain for two nuclides: The rate of change of NB, that is dNB/dt, is related to the changes in the amounts of A and B, NB can increase as B is produced from A and decrease as B produces C. Re-writing using the previous results: d

{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} N_{B}}{\mathrm {d} t}}=-\lambda _{B}N_{B}+\lambda _{A}N_{A0}e^{-\lambda _{A}t}} The subscripts simply refer to the respective nuclides, i.e. NA is the number of nuclides of type A; NA0 is the initial number of nuclides of type A; λA is the decay constant for A – and similarly for nuclide B. Solving this equation for NB gives: In the case where B is a stable nuclide (λB = 0), this equation reduces to the previous solution: as shown above for one decay. The solution can be found by the integration factor method, where the integrating factor is eλBt. This case is perhaps the most useful since it can derive both the one-decay equation (above) and the equation for multi-decay chains (below) more directly. For the general case of any number of consecutive decays in a decay chain, i.e. A1 → A2 ··· → Ai ··· → AD, where D is the number of decays and i is a dummy index (i = 1, 2, 3, ...D), each nuclide population can be found in terms of the previous population. In this case N2 = 0, N3 = 0,..., ND = 0. Using the above result in a recursive form: The general solution to the recursive problem is given by Bateman's equations: N

done,"Carol (soundtrack) [HEAD] Development [SEP] Burwell had received the script of Carol before the film began principal photography. Director Todd Haynes sent him six CDs of songs from the 1950s that he and music supervisor Randy Poster had compiled. However, Burwell didn't begin composing the music until Haynes shot and assembled the film. Initially, Burwell considered using two solo instruments, as there were only two main characters and everyone else just passes through. Burwell began recording the track titled ""Opening"". He stated that composing such a piece first was an odd choice because none of the main characters appear in the opening scene. However, he felt it was important that what he composed induced the mood of the film and the unseen characters. Burwell also wrote several different ideas for this and sent them to Haynes. Burwell wrote the score with a small ensemble consisting of eight to 17 musicians. The smallest arrangement consisted of string quartets with bass, harp, piano and clarinet. Apart from orchestration and conducting the score, the music was performed by the Seattle Symphony. The whole process, writing, recording and mixing, took about eight weeks for 38 minutes of music. Burwell described the character of Carol (played by Cate Blanchett) as ""a cypher"" and ""a cool, aloof mystery"". The instruments he composer John Burwell used for her the character Carol were piano , clarinet and vibe . According to Burwell, there are three main themes in the score that communicate visual language. The music heard in the opening city scene depicts the ""active engagement and passion"" of Carol and Therese (played by Rooney Mara), conveying something about the characters before they are seen. This music becomes their love theme. For the theme expressing Therese's fascination with Carol, Burwell introduced a cloud of piano notes. The piano texture ""required a little studio magic"" with notes played differently by right and left hand; where the notes played by the left hand disappear into a cloud and those played by the right remain distinct enough to carry the melody. This was realized in the scene where Carol drives Therese to her house for the first time. The music appears like a public courtship moving somewhere private and thus the solo notes heard were the delay effects of notes that pile up into a cloud. The third theme is about absence and loss. The theme was expressed in the voice-over scene where Therese reads the letter from Carol explaining herself and the need to hasten back to New York. Burwell wrote open intervals such as the fourth, fifth and ninth, to hide the sentiment. Both women are brokenhearted and the music reflects the emptiness they feel.","The instruments he used for her were piano, clarinet and vibe.","The instruments composer John Burwell used for the character Carol were piano, clarinet and vibe.",n,hallucinated 'john'

imp,"Jezreel Valley [HEAD] History ; British Mandate [SEP] After the land was sold to the American Zion Commonwealth, some of the Arab farmers who lived in nearby villages and had been working for the absentee landowners were given financial compensation or were provided with land elsewhere. Despite the sale, some of the farmers refused to leave their land, as in Afula (El-Ful), however the new owners decided that it would be inappropriate for these farmers to remain as tenants on land intended for Jewish labor. This was a commonplace feeling among segments of the Jewish population , part of a socialist ideology of the Yishuv , which included their working the land rather than being absentee landowners . British police had to be used to expel some and the dispossessed made their way to the coast to search for new work with most ending up in shanty towns on the edges of Jaffa and Haifa. Following the purchase of the land, the Jewish farmers created the first modern-day settlements, founded the modern day city of Afula and drained the swamps to enable further land development of areas that had been uninhabitable for centuries. The first moshav, Nahalal, was settled in this valley on 11 September 1921. After the widespread Arab riots of 1929 in the then British Mandate of Palestine, the Hope Simpson Enquiry was appointed to seek causes and remedies for the instability. The Commission's findings in regard to ""Government responsibility towards Arab cultivators"", was that the Jewish authorities ""have nothing with which to reproach themselves"" in the purchase of the valley, noting the high prices paid and land occupants receiving compensation not legally bound. The responsibility of the Mandate Government for ""soreness felt (among both effendi and fellahin) owing to the sale of large areas by the absentee Sursock family"" and the displacement of Arab tenants; noted that, ""the duty of the Administration of Palestine to ensure that the rights and position of the Arabs are not prejudiced by Jewish immigration.

done,"Moroccan frigate Hassan II [HEAD] Design and description [SEP] The Floréal-class frigates were designed in response to a demand for a cheap warship capable of operating in low threat areas and able to perform general patrol functions. As a result, the Floréal class were constructed to mercantile standards in the areas of ammunition stowage, helicopter facilities and damage control, which significantly lowered the cost of the vessels. The Floréal class were designed for using modular construction which shortened their building times. The Moroccan frigates of the class are similar to those in French service with a few changes. Hassan II has a standard displacement of 2,600 tonnes (2,600 long tons) and 3,000 tonnes (2,950 long tons) at full load. The frigate measures 85.2 metres (279 ft 6 in) long between perpendiculars and 93.5 metres (306 ft 9 in) overall with a beam of 14 metres (45 ft 11 in) and a draught of 4.3 m (14 ft 1 in). Due to the frigate's broad beam, the ship is equipped with fin stabilisers. The frigate is powered by a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) system comprising four SEMT Pielstick 6 PA6 L280 BPC diesel engines driving two shafts each turning a LIPS controllable pitch propeller. The CODAD system is rated at 7,200 kilowatts (9,600 hp) The vessel is also equipped with one 250-kilowatt (340 hp) bow thruster. Due to the mercantile construction design, the four diesels are all located within one machinery room for ease of maintenance. Both diesel fuel and TR5 aviation fuel is brought aboard at a single location at the stern compared to naval-constructed vessels which sport two. The ship also has three 750 kW (1,010 hp) diesel-electric generators located just fore and aft of the machinery room. Hassan II has a maximum speed of 20 knots (37 km/h; 23 mph) and a range of 10,000 nautical miles (19,000 km; 12,000 mi) at 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph). Hassan II is armed with two Exocet MM38 surface-to-surface missiles in launchers situated centrally atop the midships superstructure. The ship also mounts one Otobreda 76 mm (3 in) gun turret with Najir fire control system located forwards. The vessel is capable of being armed with two 20 mm modèle F2 guns situated in atop the aft superstructure. In place of the 20 mm (0.8 in) guns, the Moroccan Floréal-class frigates can be fitted with twin launchers for Simbad surface-to-air missiles. The ship is equipped with two Decca Bridgemaster radars, one for use as navigational radar, the other for helicopter control, Thomsen-CSF ARBR 17 radar intercept electronic surveillance systems and two Dagaie decoy systems. The frigate is equipped with a 30-by-15-metre (98 by 49 ft) helicopter landing pad located on the stern and a 10-by-15-metre (33 by 49 ft) hangar.

It was first achieved in 1895 by Archie MacLaren, playing for Lancashire against Somerset, while both the most recent occurrences have been by Brian Lara, who is also the only player to have managed the feat in Test cricket. Lara holds the record for the highest score in first-class cricket, having made 501 not out in 1994. Bill Ponsford is the only other player to have scored two quadruple centuries, doing so in 1923 and 1927 for the Victoria cricket team. Ponsford's scores were both made at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, making it one of two venues to have hosted two quadruple centuries, along with the County Ground, Taunton. Two teams have conceded two quadruple centuries; Somerset and Queensland. Don Bradman's score of 452 not out was made in the shortest time of all quadruple centuries; his innings lasting 415 minutes (6 hours and 55 minutes). Lara's Test quadruple was the longest, taking 778 minutes (12 hours and 58 minutes). Bradman's quadruple century was also the only one to be scored in a team's second batting innings.

The house was built in 1671-1672 by architect Mathias Spieler for the Dutch-born Swedish military officer Thomas van der Noot. The facade has pilasters and festoons and the middle part is decorated with mermaids in the sandstone. Two wings frame a small garden. The building was first used as a residence for various Dutch ministers. In 1740, a second building was erected that was used as a church for the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1770 it was made into a tobacco factory. In the late 19th century the building was in disrepair and was threatened with demolition. The house was saved by Jean Jahnsson, owner of C.G. Hallberg, who turned it into a private residence. Architects for the renovation and expansion in 1903-1910 were IG Clason and Agi Lindegren. Jahnsson gathered a rich collection at the palace, including mainly Swedish silverware, a collection of hundreds of spoons from the 15th century onwards, porcelain, an unmatched collection of precious bejeweled gold boxes, Swedish miniatures, art furniture, Swedish engraving portraits and a library about much more than 100,000 volumes, including nearly complete collections of Swedish dramatic literature and Reformation writings, Swedish history books and documents etc. Jahnsson was hit hard by the Kreuger crash in the early 1930s, in which he was stripped of his wealth and forced to leave the Van der Nootska Palace and auction off most of the collections. Stensund Castle was sold to Carl Matthiessen, 1933, and the weapons collection auctioned off .

imp,"Pierre Auguste Brahain Ducange [HEAD] The coup d'état of 22 January 1798 and its aftermath [SEP] At this time the politicians of the Batavian Republic were in the process of writing a Constitution amid much political strife. Roughly speaking there were three political factions vying to get the upper hand: a group of ""federalists,"" who wanted to maintain the decentralized structure of the old Dutch Republic; and two factions of ""unitarists,"" one moderate, and one radical, who wanted to transform the new Republic into a unitary state. It was Delacroix' mission to impose a Constitution following the model of the Constitution of the Year III. However, in this task he was hindered by the fact that he didn't speak Dutch. Ducange, on the other hand was fluent in Dutch, and therefore able to act as Delacroix' trusted henchman in this projet d'une constitution pour la République batave. However, Ducange acted more as an intermediary with the radical faction of unitarists, and thanks to him Delacroix in the course of January, 1798 accepted their version of the draft-Constitution in preference to the French draft. This official French endorsement encouraged the radicals to impose their will by force on their political opponents. On 22 January 1798 Dutch and French troops, commanded by generals Daendels and Joubert, surrounded The Hague, and the political opponents of the radicals in the National Assembly were arrested. The rump-Assembly next declared itself to be a Constituante, ready to promulgate a new constitution. A committee was charged with drafting this new constitution. Ducange took part in the deliberations of this committee on a daily basis (reporting back to Delacroix each night), and even translated certain parts into French for the benefit of his French principals. The fact that he kept a watchful eye, and that Delacroix had to trust his reports implicitly, probably helped to smooth the acceptance of the draft by the French ""sister republic,"" even though it was not a slavish copy of the French model, and contained some peculiarly Dutch elements. The draft-constitution was approved in a referendum on 25 April and came into force on 1 May. However, soon discontent with the high-handed policies of the radicals began to grow. This discontent was also directed against Ducange, whose sometimes abrasive behavior and evident influential position were resented. He was specifically blamed for the decision of the radicals on 4 May to continue the rump-Assembly in office and not to hold new elections. Soon intrigues back in Paris caused the Directoire to demand his recall to France. Delacroix own recall soon followed .

done,"Common loon [HEAD] Distribution and habitat [SEP] Common loons are mainly Nearctic, and breed from 48° N to the Arctic Circle, locally south to 40° N and north to 78° N. During their breeding season in spring and summer, most common loons live on lakes and other waterways in the northern United States and Canada, as well as in southern parts of Greenland, in Iceland, in Svalbard, in Jan Mayen, and in Bear Island in Norway; and in Alaska, to the west, and very rarely in Scotland, to the east. Their summer habitat ranges from wooded lakes to tundra ponds. The lakes must be large enough for flight take-off, and provide a large population of small fish. Deep lakes with warm surface waters, relatively low biological productivity and low turbidity where their fish prey are easy to see are habitats where breeding loons are more successful in raising young. For protection from predators, common loons favour lakes with islands and coves. They are rare visitors to the Arctic coast. They Common loons are known to exhibit high breeding site fidelity . Some common loons remain in Iceland year-round, although most migrate. In North America, they winter mainly along north Atlantic and north-east Pacific coasts, many stopping off on the Great Lakes during their migration. They migrate in the day, starting about two hours after sunrise and flying at altitudes of 1500 to 2700 m above sea level, above the convective and turbulent layer of air. In winter they can be seen on North America coasts as far south as Baja California, Sonora, northern Sinaloa, southern Texas, and rarely northern Tamaulipas. In the east, several thousand winter along western European coasts, probably originating from Iceland, Greenland, and Canada. Their range extends into northwestern Europe from Finland to Portugal and southern and northwestern Spain (Galicia and Asturias), as well as the western Mediterranean off Catalonia, and off Morocco in Africa, although only a few hundred travel as far south as Iberia. Although wintering site fidelity is not well known, annually, adults are observed to return to the same wintering locations in the Pacific Ocean (Morro Bay), the Gulf of Mexico (Barataria Bay), the Atlantic Ocean (Maryland and Massachusetts), and the reservoir Lake Pateros. They usually winter along coasts and on inland lakes, bays, inlets, and streams, with birds migrating to the nearest body of water that will not freeze over in the winter: western Canadian loons go to the Pacific, Great Lakes loons to the Gulf of Mexico region, eastern Canadian loons to the Atlantic, and some loons to large inland lakes and reservoirs. They appear in most of the inland waters of the United States. The South Carolina coast, the Gulf coast adjacent to the Florida panhandle, and the Atlantic seaboard from Massachusetts to Maine have some of the highest concentrations of common loons.

done,"Soviet Union [HEAD] Economy [SEP] The Soviet Union adopted a command economy, whereby production and distribution of goods were centralized and directed by the government. The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of War communism, which involved the nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive requisition of agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate money circulation, private enterprises and free trade. After the severe economic collapse, Lenin replaced war communism by the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921, legalizing free trade and private ownership of small businesses. The economy quickly recovered as a result. After a long debate among the members of the Politburo about the course of economic development, by 1928–1929, upon gaining control of the country, Stalin abandoned the NEP and pushed for full central planning, starting forced collectivization of agriculture and enacting draconian labor legislation. Resources were mobilized for rapid industrialization, which significantly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the 1930s. The primary motivation for industrialization was preparation for war, mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalist world. As a result, the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial power, leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after World War II. The war caused extensive devastation of the Soviet economy and infrastructure, which required massive reconstruction. By the early 1940s, the Soviet economy had become relatively self-sufficient; for most of the period until the creation of Comecon, only a tiny share of domestic products was traded internationally. After the creation of the Eastern Bloc, external trade rose rapidly. However, the influence of the world economy on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on foreign trade. Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the 1960s. During the arms race of the Cold War, the Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures, heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry. At the same time, the USSR became the largest arms exporter to the Third World. Significant amounts of Soviet resources during the Cold War were allocated in aid to the other socialist states. From the 1930s until its dissolution in late 1991, the way the Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged. The Soviet Union economy was formally directed by central planning , carried out by Gosplan and organized in five - year plans . However, in practice, the plans were highly aggregated and provisional, subject to ad hoc intervention by superiors. All critical economic decisions were taken by the political leadership. Allocated resources and plan targets were usually denominated in rubles rather than in physical goods. Credit was discouraged, but widespread. The final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized, unplanned contracting. Although in theory prices were legally set from above, in practice they were often negotiated, and informal horizontal links (e.g. between producer factories) were widespread. A number of basic services were state-funded, such as education and health care. In the manufacturing sector, heavy industry and defence were prioritized over consumer goods. Consumer goods, particularly outside large cities, were often scarce, of poor quality and limited variety. Under the command economy, consumers had almost no influence on production, and the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices. A massive unplanned second economy grew up at low levels alongside the planned one, providing some of the goods and services that the planners could not. The legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the reform of 1965.","The economy was formally directed by central planning, carried out by Gosplan and organized in five-year plans.","The Soviet Union economy was formally directed by central planning, carried out by Gosplan and organized in five-year plans.",y,
done,"Sleepy Hollow (film) [HEAD] Production ; Design ; Cinematography [SEP] Burton was impressed by the cinematography in Great Expectations (1998) and hired Emmanuel Lubezki as Sleepy Hollow's director of photography. Initially, Lubezki and Burton contemplated shooting the film in black and white, and in old square Academy ratio. When that proved unfeasible, they opted for an almost monochromatic effect which would enhance the fantasy aspect. Burton and Lubezki intentionally planned the over-dependency of smoke and soft lighting to accompany the film's sole wide-angle lens strategy. Emmanuel Lubezki also used Hammer horror and Mexican lucha films from the 1960s , such as Santo Contra los Zombis and Santo vs . las Mujeres Vampiro for the film Sleepy Hollow . Lighting effects increased the dynamic energy of the Headless Horseman, while the contrast of the film stock was increased in post-production to add to the monochromatic feel. Leavesden Studios, a converted airplane factory, presented problems because of its relatively low ceilings. This was less of an issue for The Phantom Menace, in which set height was generally achieved by digital means. ""Our visual choices get channeled and violent,"" Heinrichs elaborated, ""so you end up with liabilities that you tend to exploit as virtues. When you've got a certain ceiling height, and you're dealing with painted backings, you need to push atmosphere and diffusion."" This was particularly the case in several exteriors that were built on sound stages.

done,"Frithjof Schuon [HEAD] Views based on his written works ; Spiritual practice ; Spiritual path [SEP] According to the writer Ali Lakhani, ""Schuon emphasizes that the meaning of life is nothing less than the quest for [...] God, [...] for the Truth that resides within each of us; [...] it is the return to the heart-consciousness of the Divine Presence."" For Schuon, man is ""a bridge between Earth and Heaven. [...] The notion of the Absolute and the love of God constitute the very essence of his subjectivity. This subjectivity is a proof both of his immortality and of God; it is, properly speaking, a theophany."" Schuon reminds us that religious or spiritual life offers three fundamental paths, which correspond to as many human temperaments: 1) the path of action, works, asceticism, fear (the karma-mārga or karma-yoga of Hinduism); 2) the path of love, of devotion (bhakti-mārga); and 3) the path of gnosis, of unitive contemplation (jñāna-mārga); in Sufism: makhāfah, mahabbah, ma`rifah. The first two are dualistic and exoteric, and are based on revelation, whereas the path of knowledge is monistic and esoteric, and based on intellection supported by revelation. Just as the path of love cannot do without good works and reverential fear, so the esoteric or metaphysical path cannot exclude the two other modes. According to Schuon, the path of knowledge or of gnosis, which is present at the heart of every religion, is essentially: 1) discernment between the Real and the illusory, ātmā and māyā, nirvāna and samsāra, the Absolute and the relative, God and the world; 2) concentration on the Real, and 3) intrinsinc morality, virtue. This discernment would remain purely mental in the absence of concentration on the Real through rites and prayer, i.e. without an effective link with God, the Sovereign Good, based on an authentic piety and sufficient detachment from the ego and from the world. The way towards God , as Frithjof Schuon points out , "" always involves an inversion : from outwardness one must pass to inwardness , from multiplicity to unity , from dispersion to concentration , from egoism to detachment , from passion to serenity . "" The exoteric and esoteric rites of the religion practised – and of that one alone – are the basis for the spiritual method. Prayer is its central element, for without it – and without divine grace – the heart cannot assimilate or realize what the mind has been able to grasp. Schuon recalls the three modes of prayer: personal prayer in which the worshipper opens himself spontaneously and informally to God; canonical, impersonal prayer, prescribed by his tradition; and invocatory prayer or ""prayer of the heart"" (japa, dhikr), which ""is already a death and a meeting with God and places us already in Eternity; it is already something of Paradise and even, in its mysterious and 'uncreated' quintessence, something of God"". This form of prayer is the invocation of a divine name, a sacred formula, a mantra; it reconciles the transcendence and the immanence of Truth, because if, on the one hand, Truth transcends us infinitely, the gnostic knows that it is also ""inscribed in an eternal script in the very substance of [his] spirit""; God is both the highest and the deepest, and the knowledge the realized being has of God is in reality the knowledge that God has of Himself through that being.","The way towards God, as Schuon points out, ""always involves an inversion: from outwardness one must pass to inwardness, from multiplicity to unity, from dispersion to concentration, from egoism to detachment, from passion to serenity.""","The way towards God, as Frithjof Schuon points out, ""always involves an inversion: from outwardness one must pass to inwardness, from multiplicity to unity, from dispersion to concentration, from egoism to detachment, from passion to serenity.""",t,

The Later Liang military governor of Huguo Circuit (護國, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), Zhu Youqian, did not believe Zhu Yougui and resisted Zhu Yougui's subsequent summons to the capital Luoyang. When Zhu Yougui subsequently sent the generals Kang Huaizhen (康懷貞) and Niu Cunjie (牛存節) to attack Zhu Youqian, Zhu Youqian submitted to Jin and requested immediate aid. Li Cunxu sent Li Cunshen, Li Sigong, and Li Si'en (李嗣恩, another adoptive son of Li Keyong's) to aid Zhu Youqian; they had some victories over Later Liang forces, and after Li Cunxu himself joined them, Later Liang forces withdrew from Huguo. In 915, by which time Zhu Yougui had been killed and replaced by his brother Zhu Zhen, Yang, who had been the military governor of the powerful Tianxiong Circuit (天雄, headquartered in modern Handan, also known as Weibo (魏博)), died. Zhu Zhen, believing that the Weibo army was difficult to control and needed to have its influence reduced, divided Tianxiong into two circuits, with three of its six prefectures, including Tianxiong's capital Wei Prefecture (魏州), governed by He Delun, and with the other prefectures made into a new Zhaode Circuit (昭德), headquartered at Xiang Prefecture (相州, in modern Anyang, Henan), with Zhang Yun (張筠) as its military governor. The Tianxiong forces did not want to be divided, and they mutinied under the leadership of Zhang Yan (張彥), kidnapping He Delun and forcing him to submit to Jin. Hearing of what happened at Tianxiong, Li Cunxu proceeded quickly toward Wei Prefecture, joining forces with Li Cunshen to Linqing (臨清, in modern Lintai).

Prior to D-Day on November 10, no preliminary reconnaissance was performed except the submarine periscope photography taken by Capt. James Jones, of VAC Amphib Recon Company aboard the USS Nautilus (SS-168). The first ashore at Betio was a Scout-Sniper Platoon of 2nd Marine Regiment led by 1st Lieutenant William D. Hawkins. Hawkins was tasked with securing the island ramp on one of the two long piers extending into the lagoon. He and his recon-scout platoon raced ahead of the first wave in two Higgins Boats and landed on the pier where they were placed under heavy machine gun fire. Since there were petrol drums at the end of the pier in the line of enemy fire, Hawkins sent most of his Marines back down the ramp then proceeded with only five men, four scouts and one combat engineer with a flamethrower. Once they burned and had blown up every hiding place left on the pier, they withdrew to the boat. Hawkins then commandeered three LVTs and transferred his men from both LCVPs to these for the trip to shore where they joined their regiment for the rest of the battle. Hawkins was later killed during this action and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

The 74-gun HMS Elephant, under Captain George Dundas gave chase, and the two ships exchanged several broadsides. The 18-gun sloop HMS Snake appeared on the north-west quarter, but the Elephant, either because of the appearance of Guerrière to windward, or for another unexplained reason, failed to maintain her position alongside Duguay-Trouin. Consequently, both French ships were able to escape. However, Duquesne, a 74-gun armed en flûte (removing some or all of her armament), was captured. Duguay-Trouin and Guerrière made for the European coast, eventually making the port of Ferrol in Spain. On 29 August they were spotted by the 38-gun frigate HMS Boadicea, under the command of Captain John Maitland. Unable to make out what the unknown ships he had sighted were, he gave chase. Before nightfall he had discerned that the ships were enemies, but heavy fog made it impossible to determine their disposition until just after midday on 31 August, when it became clear that one of them was a 74 gunner and together, they were more than a match for Boadicea.

The works consist of published volumes, essays, lectures, letters, and a dissertation written by Jung from 1902 until his death in 1961. The compilation by the editors dates from 1945 onward. The series contains revised versions of works previously published, works not previously translated, and new translations of many of Jung's writings. Several of the volumes of The Collected Works of C . G . Jung are extensively illustrated ; each contains an index and most contain a bibliography . Until his death, Jung supervised the revisions of the text, some of which were extensive. A body of Jung's work still remains unpublished. Princeton University Press published these volumes in the United States as part of its Bollingen Series of books. Routledge & Kegan Paul published them independently in the United Kingdom. In general, the Princeton editions are not available for sale in The Commonwealth, except for Canada, and the Routledge editions are not available for sale in the US. There are many differences in publication dates between the Princeton and Routledge series, as well as some differences in edition numbers and the styling of titles; there are also various hardback and paperback versions, as well as some ebooks, available from both publishers, each with its own ISBN. This article shows dates and titles for hardback (cloth) volumes in the catalog of the Princeton University Press, which also includes paperback and ebook versions. Information about the Routledge series can be found in its own catalogue. A digital edition, complete except for the General Index in Volume 20, is also available.

He is the coolest and best-in-class god of Olympus and the absolute support of the majority of women. He likes to play music with lyre and shoots arrows well. Women tend to fall over their shiny teeth between their smiling lips, turning their golden hair over head banging. Like the image of the sun, he is full of confidence and vitality, and he speaks pleasantly. He speaks and acts while keeping the principle of moderation, but when he goes against himself or hurts his pride, he gets angry and always makes his surroundings a mess.

done,"Type 025 torpedo boat [HEAD] Variants [SEP] The Type 025 was originally designed to solve the problems presented by existing Soviet torpedo boats in the Chinese inventory. The P 4-class torpedo boat (Type K-123) was lightly armed, and thus did not have sufficient self-defense firepower in a retreat after having launched its torpedoes. The P 6-class torpedo boat (Type K-183) had enough guns for self-defense, but its wooden hull was vulnerable to fire if hit. The Type 025 was subsequently developed to incorporate the advantages of both classes by adopting the metallic hull of the P 4 class and the heavier self-defense armament of the P 6 class. Several versions of the class exist, which differ mainly in their secondary armament. For example, some had extra guns in addition to the standard 14.5 mm heavy machine guns, while others had the capability to carry and lay two additional mines. Due to the different the weapons carried, the complement of each boat varies from 11 to 16. Structurally, some of the hulls have an additional pair of small hydrofoils near the bow, while others do not have hydrofoils at all. Guns are usually mounted aft, but some examples of the type possess one forward mounting and one aft.

done,"Technical features new to Windows Vista [HEAD] Audio ; Audio stack architecture [SEP] Applications communicate with the audio driver through Sessions, and these Sessions are programmed through the Windows Audio Session API (WASAPI). In general, WASAPI operates in two modes. In exclusive mode (also called DMA mode), unmixed audio streams are rendered directly to the audio adapter and no other application's audio will play and signal processing has no effect. Exclusive Windows Vista ' s exclusive mode is useful for applications that demand the least amount of intermediate processing of the audio data or those that want to output compressed audio data such as Dolby Digital , DTS or WMA Pro over S / PDIF . WASAPI exclusive mode is similar to kernel streaming in function, but no kernel mode programming is required. In shared mode, audio streams are rendered by the application and optionally applied per-stream audio effects known as Local Effects (LFX) (such as per-session volume control). Then the streams are mixed by the global audio engine, where a set of global audio effects (GFX) may be applied. Finally, they're rendered on the audio device. After passing through WASAPI, all host-based audio processing, including custom audio processing, can take place. Host-based processing modules are referred to as Audio Processing Objects, or APOs. All these components operate in user mode, only the audio driver runs in kernel mode. The Windows Kernel Mixer (KMixer) is completely gone. DirectSound and MME are emulated as Session instances rather than being directly connected to the audio driver.

done,"Deficit reduction in the United States [HEAD] Specific deficit reduction proposals ; Republican proposals [SEP] Rep. Paul Ryan (R) has proposed the Roadmap for America's Future, which is a series of budgetary reforms. His January 2010 version of the plan includes partial privatization of Social Security, the transition of Medicare to a voucher system, discretionary spending cuts and freezes, and tax reform. A series of graphs and charts summarizing the impact of the plan are included. Economists have both praised and criticized particular features of the plan. The CBO also did a partial evaluation of the bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) was very critical of the Roadmap. Rep. Ryan provided a response to the CBPP's analysis. The House of Representatives Committee on the Budget, chaired by Paul Ryan, released a budget resolution in April 2011, titled The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America's Promise. The Path focuses on tax reform (lowering income tax rates and reducing tax expenditures or loopholes); spending cuts and controls; and redesign of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. It The Path to Prosperity : Restoring America ' s Promise does not propose significant changes to Social Security . The CBO did an analysis of the resolution (a less rigorous evaluation than full scoring of legislation), estimating that the Path would balance the budget by 2030 and reduce the level of debt held by the public to 10% GDP by 2050, vs. 62% in 2010. The Path assumes revenue collection of 19% GDP after 2022, up from the current 15% GDP and closer to the historical average of 18.3% GDP. A grouping of spending categories called ""Other Mandatory and Defense and Non-Defense Discretionary spending"" would be reduced from 12% GDP in 2010 to 3.5% by 2050. Economist Paul Krugman called it ""ridiculous and heartless"" due to a combination of income tax rate reductions (which he argued mainly benefit the wealthy) and large spending cuts that would affect the poor and middle classes. The Republican Party website includes an alternative budget proposal provided to the President in January 2010. It includes lower taxes, lower annual increases in entitlement spending growth, and marginally higher defense spending than the President's 2011 budget proposal. During September 2010, Republicans published ""A Pledge to America"" which advocated a repeal of recent healthcare legislation, reduced spending and the size of government, and tax reductions.

Most use a behavior modification paradigm. Others are relationally oriented. Some utilize a community or positive peer-culture model. Generalist programs are usually large (80-plus clients and as many as 250) and level-focused in their treatment approach. That is, in order to manage clients' behavior, they frequently put systems of rewards and punishments in place. Specialist programs residential treatment centers are usually smaller ( less than 100 clients and as few as 10 or 12 ) . Specialist programs typically are not as focused on behavior modification as generalist programs are. Different RTCs work with different types of problems, and the structure and methods of RTCs vary. Some RTCs are lock-down facilities; that is, the residents are locked inside the premises. In a locked residential treatment facility, clients' movements are restricted. By comparison, an unlocked residential treatment facility allows them to move about the facility with relative freedom, but they are only allowed to leave the facility under specific conditions. Residential treatment centers should not be confused with residential education programs, which offer an alternative environment for at-risk children to live and learn together outside their homes. Residential treatment centers for children and adolescents treat multiple conditions from drug and alcohol addictions to emotional and physical disorders as well as mental illnesses. Various studies of youth in residential treatment centers have found that many have a history of family-related issues, often including physical or sexual abuse. Some facilities address specialized disorders, such as reactive attachment disorder (RAD). Residential treatment centers generally are clinically focused and primarily provide behavior management and treatment for adolescents with serious issues. In contrast, therapeutic boarding schools provide therapy and academics in a residential boarding school setting, employing staff of social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists to work with the students on a daily basis.

un,"Interprocedural optimization [HEAD] WPO and LTO [SEP] Whole program optimization (WPO) is the compiler optimization of a program using information about all the modules in the program. Normally, optimizations are performed on a per module, ""compiland"", basis; but this approach, while easier to write and test and less demanding of resources during the compilation itself, does not allow certainty about the safety of a number of optimizations such as aggressive inlining and thus cannot perform them even if they would actually turn out to be efficiency gains that do not change the semantics of the emitted object code. Link-time optimization (LTO) is a type of program optimization performed by a compiler to a program at link time. Link time optimization is relevant in programming languages that compile programs on a file-by-file basis, and then link those files together (such as C and Fortran), rather than all at once (such as Java's just-in-time compilation (JIT)). Once all files have been compiled separately into object files, traditionally, a compiler links (merges) the object files into a single file, the executable. However, in LTO as implemented by the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) or LLVM, the compiler is able to dump its intermediate representation (GIMPLE bytecode or LLVM bitcode) to disk so that all the different compilation units that will go to make up a single executable can be optimized as a single module when the link finally happens. This expands the scope of interprocedural optimizations to encompass the whole program (or, rather, everything that is visible at link time). With link-time optimization, the compiler can apply various forms of interprocedural optimization to the whole program, allowing for deeper analysis, more optimization, and ultimately better program performance. In practice, LTO does not always optimize the entire program -- library functions, especially dynamically linked shared objects, are intentionally kept out to avoid excessive duplication and to allow for updating. Static linking does naturally lend to the concept of LTO , but it only works with library archives that contain IR objects as opposed to machine - code only object files . Due to performance concerns, not even the entire unit is always directly used -- a program could be partitioned in a divide-and-conquer style LTO such as GCC's WHOPR. And of course, when the program being built is itself a library, the optimization would keep every externally-available (exported) symbol, without trying too hard at removing them as a part of DCE. A much more limited form of WPO is still possible without LTO, as exemplified by GCC's -fwhole-program switch. This mode makes GCC assume that the module being compiled contains the entry point (usually main()) of the entire program, so that every other function in it is not externally used and can be safely optimized away. Since it only applies to one module only, it cannot truly encompass the whole program. (It can be combined with LTO in the one-big-module sense, useful when the linker is not communicating back to GCC about what entry points or symbols are being used externally.)","Static linking does naturally lend to the concept of LTO, but it only works with library archives that contain IR objects as opposed to machine-code only object files.","Static linking does naturally lend to the concept of LTO, but it only works with library archives that contain IR objects as opposed to machine-code only object files.",,

done,"USS Willoughby (AGP-9) [HEAD] United States Navy service ; World War II ; Philippines campaign [SEP] All boats attached to Willoughby participated in that important encounter, while the tender herself remained at San Pedro Bay. The battle was just one part of the larger Battle of Leyte Gulf of 23 October 1944 – 26 October 1944, in which the Imperial Japanese Navy suffered a crushing defeat. In ensuing days, Willoughby experienced Japanese air attacks at odd intervals during daylight hours. On the morning of 27 October 1944, one of her boats came under attack by Japanese planes, when a Mitsubishi A6M Zero (or ""Zeke"") dropped a fragmentation bomb off the bow of USS PT-152. Two men died and eight were wounded; the boat subsequently pulled next to Willoughby and transferred the dead and wounded to the tender. Also while at San Pedro Bay, Willoughby experienced a storm of typhoon intensity on 30 October 1944. During that spell of heavy weather, the storm carried away one of the ship's motor launches, but it was later recovered. The ship herself suffered no damage. From 31 October 1944 to 12 November 1944, Willoughby experienced daily air raids. On 5 November 1944, Japanese planes scored a direct hit on USS PT-320, moored off the tender's starboard bow, demolishing the boat and killing nearly the entire crew; only one man survived. A week later, on 12 November 1944, a flight of suicide aircraft attacked; while Willoughby herself was not touched, she witnessed kamikazes crash into landing craft repair ships USS Egeria (ARL-8) and USS Achilles (ARL-41). Willoughby and her sister ship Wachapreague retired from Leyte on 13 November 1944 and arrived at Mios Woendi on 16 November. On 17 and 18 November 1944, the motor torpedo boat tenders loaded stores and supplies. Later, in company with motor torpedo boat tender USS Pontus (AGP-20), Wachapreague, seven Army crash boats and 41 PT boats, Willoughby departed New Guinea and proceeded vai Kossol Roads back to the Philippines, in a repeat performance of the previous mass movement of PT boats from New Guinea to that strategic archipelago. After servicing the PT boats en route, at Kossol Roads, on 23 November 1944, Willoughby steamed into Leyte Gulf, arriving late on 27 November 1944. The tender manned her general quarters stations when a large American task force nearby – composed of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers – underwent a Japanese air attack. Shells from friendly ships fell ""perilously near"" Willoughby, but she emerged unscathed as the force repulsed the Japanese raid. Shifting to Espiritu Santo soon thereafter, Willoughby picked up necessary spare parts vital to the continued operation of PT boats in the Philippine Islands on 4 January 1945 and departed for the Treasury Islands on 5 January 1945, where she picked up more spare parts after her arrival on 8 January 1945. She continued loading operations at Green Island, Emirau Island, and Manus before returning to the Philippines, anchoring in San Juanico Strait on 18 January 1945. Over the next three days, Willoughby unloaded the vital spares that had been gathered on the recently completed voyage. She then USS Willoughby ( AGP - 9 ) steamed to Mangarin Bay , off Mindoro Island , towing a fuel barge and a small pontoon drydock , and in company with 25 Army tugs escorted by two destroyer escorts , and arrived there on 31 January 1945 .

done,"Chiselhampton [HEAD] Chapel and parish church [SEP] By 1146 Chiselhampton had a chapel dedicated to Saint Mary. It was a peculier of Dorchester Abbey and seems not to have been an independent parish. St Mary's had no graveyard: villagers buried their dead at Stadhampton, which was another of Dorchester Abbey's chapels and peculiers. St Mary's chapel remained under Dorchester Abbey until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536, when Stadhampton became a parish separate from Dorchester. Chiselhampton seems then to have become a chapelry of Stadhampton. Despite this new status, until about 1835 clergy for both Chiselhampton and Stadhampton were licensed not by the Bishop of Oxford but by the peculier of Dorchester. After the English Reformation Chiselhampton and Stadhampton always shared the same parish clergy. Until 1706 St Mary's chapel was reported to be in a good state of repair, but by 1717 the parish curate had taken the villagers to the peculier court in Dorchester for failing to pay the church rate for the building's upkeep. In 1763 Charles Peers told the court that St Mary's was in ""so ruinous and decayed a condition that the inhabitants cannot assemble for worship without manifest hazard [to] their lives"", and so he requested permission to demolish the chapel and build a new one. In 1763 Charles Peers had the Medieval chapel demolished and the materials re-used to build a Georgian church on a new site beside the main Oxford - Stadhampton road. That same year it was completed and John Hume, Bishop of Oxford consecrated it. Peers provided the new church with a graveyard to spare villagers from having to bury their dead at Stadhampton. He dispensed with the Norman chapel's dedication to Saint Mary and had the new church dedicated to Saint Katherine. With the new church Chiselhampton was made a parish in its own right, but it continued to share the same parish clergy as Stadhampton. St Katherine's is a neoclassical building whose architect is unknown. It St Katherine ' s church has a bell - turret and clock over the west door . The interior is fitted with box pews, a west gallery on Tuscan columns, a carved altarpiece and a Jacobean pulpit which is presumed to have been re-used from St Mary's chapel. In 1952–54 the church was restored after an appeal for funds supported by the poet John Betjeman who wrote verses for it and the artist John Piper who repainted the clockface. Concealed electric lighting was installed in the pews in 1956 but St Katherine's is still largely lit by its candle-lit candelabras. The church is a Grade II* listed building. The church has since been made redundant and the ecclesiastical parish reunited with Stadhampton. The civil parishes had already been reunited in 1932. St Katherine's church is vested in the Churches Conservation Trust. Services are still held in St Katherine's three or four times a year, including reenactments of historic Anglican liturgy and west gallery music.",It has a bell-turret and clock over the west door.,St Katherine's church has a bell-turret and clock over the west door.,y,clear that it refers to a church (both before and after the sentence)

It replaced the barges and ferries which had until then served to cross the Waihou River, connected Thames to the newly drained dairy farming grounds of the Hauraki Plains, and was reckoned to have made a big difference to the local district, having marked the local shift from river transport to road transport becoming dominant, and to Thames moving from a mining town towards a farming service community. It was also considered a project typical of the time and of New Zealand Prime Minister Gordon Coates quest to develop the rural economy. Up to the 1960s, traffic used the passing bays, but after angry confrontations between motorists had become more common, lights were installed. Until that time, the bridge had still sometimes used for herding of livestock, but soon after the signalisation, further increasing traffic queues began causing calls for a replacement bridge.

done,"Louis Vuitton [HEAD] History ; Founding to World War II [SEP] The Louis Vuitton label was founded by Vuitton in 1854 on Rue Neuve des Capucines in Paris, France. Louis Vuitton started at $10,567 as a sales price. Louis Vuitton had observed that the HJ Cave Osilite trunk could be easily stacked. In 1858, Vuitton introduced his flat-topped trunks with Trianon canvas, making them lightweight and airtight. Before the introduction of Vuitton's trunks, rounded-top trunks were used, generally to promote water runoff, and thus could not be stacked. It was Vuitton's gray Trianon canvas flat trunk that allowed the ability to stack them on top of another with ease for voyages. Many other luggage makers later imitated Vuitton's style and design. The company Louis Vuitton label participated in the 1867 Universal Exhibition in Paris . In 1871, Ōyama Iwao became the first recorded Japanese customer, ordering a set of luggage while in Paris as a military observer during the Franco-Prussian War. To protect against the duplication of his look, Vuitton changed the Trianon design to a beige and brown stripes design in 1876. By 1885, the company opened its first store in London on Oxford Street. Soon thereafter, due to the continuing imitation of his look, in 1888, Vuitton created the Damier Canvas pattern, which bore a logo that reads ""marque L. Vuitton déposée"", which translates into ""L. Vuitton registered trademark"". In 1892, Louis Vuitton died, and the company's management passed to his son. After the death of his father, Georges Vuitton began a campaign to build the company into a worldwide corporation, exhibiting the company's products at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. In 1896, the company launched the signature Monogram Canvas and made the worldwide patents on it. Its graphic symbols, including quatrefoils and flowers (as well as the LV monogram), were based on the trend of using Japanese Mon designs in the late Victorian era. The patents later proved to be successful in stopping counterfeiting. In this same year, Georges travelled to the United States, where he toured cities such as New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, selling Vuitton products. In 1901, the Louis Vuitton Company introduced the Steamer Bag, a smaller piece of luggage designed to be kept inside Vuitton luggage trunks. By 1913, the Louis Vuitton Building opened on the Champs-Elysees. It was the largest travel-goods store in the world at the time. Stores also opened in New York, Bombay, Washington, London, Alexandria, and Buenos Aires as World War I began. Afterwards, in 1930, the Keepall bag was introduced. During 1932, LV introduced the Noé bag. This bag was originally made for champagne vintners to transport bottles. Soon thereafter, the Louis Vuitton Speedy bag was introduced (both are still manufactured today).

Furthermore, The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has worked with GM and other companies for decades to minimize the waste through its WasteWise program. The goal for General Motors is finding ways to recycle or reuse more than 90% of materials by: selling scrap materials, adopting reusable parts boxes to replace cardboard, and even recycling used work gloves. The remainder of the scraps might be incinerated to create energy for the plants. Besides being nature-friendly, it also saves money by cutting out waste and producing a more efficient production. Microsoft and Google are two other big companies that have Zero Waste goals. These two companies have goals to keep the majority of their waste out of landfills. Google has six locations that have a Zero Waste to Landfill goal. These locations have a goal to keep 100% of their waste out of landfills. Microsoft has a similar goal, but they are only trying to keep 90% their waste out of landfills. All these organizations push forth to make our world clean and producing zero waste.

done,"Cordes-sur-Ciel [HEAD] History [SEP] In 1222, Cordes received its charter from the Count of Toulouse to become a ""bastide"". It is generally considered to be the first of the bastides of Southwest France. (Some historians classify Montauban, built in the 12th century, as a bastide.) Bastides were ""new towns,"" originally conceived to resettle and shelter people who had been displaced by the Albigensian Crusade. They were also intended to colonize southwest France and encourage agricultural and related market development. Though not fortified, bastides were often built in defensible locations. Cordes was built between 1222 and 1229 to protect the scattered population of the area from conflict. It Cordes - sur - Ciel was intended to replace the village of Saint - Marcel , which was burnt down by the troops of Simon de Montfort in 1215 , during the Northern baron ' s crusade against the Albigensians . By the 1229 Treaty of Paris, Raymond VII of Toulouse conceded defeat to Louis IX of France. Under the terms of the treaty, he was authorized and encouraged to develop the bastides. In 1241, Jeanne, the Countess of Toulouse, married Alphonse, the brother of Louis IX and the Count of Poitiers. As a result, Cordes became a part of France in 1271 without having been militarily conquered. In 1436 Rodrigo de Villandrando pillaged Cordes as part of the Hundred Years' War. The citizens of Cordes, having built their homes within the original 13th-century ramparts, later escaped heavy damage during the religious wars at the end of the 16th century. As a result, some excellent examples of 13th and 14th-century Gothic architecture have been preserved.","It was intended to replace the village of Saint-Marcel, which was burnt down by the troops of Simon de Montfort in 1215, during the Northern baron's crusade against the Albigensians.","Cordes-sur-Ciel was intended to replace the village of Saint-Marcel, which was burnt down by the troops of Simon de Montfort in 1215, during the Northern baron's crusade against the Albigensians.",t,

Sorkin wrote several drafts of the script for A Few Good Men in his Manhattan apartment, learning the craft from a book about screenplay format. He then spent several months at the Los Angeles offices of Castle Rock, working on the script with director Rob Reiner. William Goldman (who regularly worked under contract at Castle Rock) became his mentor and helped him to adapt his stage play into a screenplay. The film, directed by Reiner, starred Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore and Kevin Bacon, and was produced by Brown. A Few Good Men was released in 1992 and was a box office success, grossing $243 million worldwide. Goldman also approached Sorkin with a story premise, which Sorkin developed into the script for the thriller Malice. Goldman oversaw the project as creative consultant while Sorkin wrote the first two drafts. However, he had to leave the project to finish the script for A Few Good Men, so screenwriter Scott Frank stepped in and wrote two drafts of the Malice screenplay. When production on A Few Good Men was completed, Sorkin resumed working on Malice right through the final shooting script. Harold Becker directed the 1993 thriller, which starred Nicole Kidman and Alec Baldwin. Malice had mixed reviews; Vincent Canby in The New York Times described the film as ""deviously entertaining from its start through its finish"". Critic Roger Ebert gave it 2 out of 4 stars, and Peter Travers in a 2000 Rolling Stone review summarized it as having ""suspense but no staying power"". Sorkin's last screenplay under Castle Rock was The American President; once again he worked with William Goldman who served as a creative consultant. It took Sorkin several years to write the screenplay for The American President, which started off at 385-pages; it was eventually reduced to a standard shooting script of around 120 pages. The film, also directed by Reiner, was critically acclaimed; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described it as ""genial and entertaining if not notably inspired"", and believed its most interesting aspects were the ""pipe dreams about the American political system and where it could theoretically be headed"". A Few Good Men , Malice and The American President grossed approximately $ 400 million worldwide . In the second half of the 1990s, Sorkin worked as a script doctor. He wrote some quips for Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage in 1996's The Rock. He worked on Excess Baggage, a 1997 comedy about a girl who stages her own kidnapping to get her father's attention, and rewrote some of Will Smith's scenes in Enemy of the State. Sorkin collaborated with Warren Beatty on several scripts, one of which was 1998's Bulworth. Beatty, known for occasionally personally financing his film projects through pre-production, also hired Sorkin to rewrite a script titled Ocean of Storms which never went into production. At one point, Sorkin sued Beatty for proper compensation for his work on the Ocean of Storms script; once the matter was settled, he resumed working on the script.","A Few Good Men, Malice and The American President grossed approximately $400 million worldwide.","A Few Good Men, Malice and The American President grossed approximately $400 million worldwide.",y,no actual change

done,"Johannes Brahms [HEAD] Music ; Style and influences [SEP] Allied to his skill in counterpoint was his subtle handling of rhythm and meter. The New Grove Dictionary of Music speculates that his contact with Hungarian and gypsy folk music as a teenager led to ""his lifelong fascination with the irregular rhythms, triplet figures and use of rubato"" in his compositions. The Hungarian Dances are among Brahms's most-appreciated pieces. According to Musgrave (1985, p. 269) ""only one composer rivals him in the advanced nature of his rhythmic thinking, and that is Stravinsky."" His consummate skills in counterpoint and rhythm are richly present in A German Requiem, a work that was partially inspired by his mother's death in 1865 (at which time he composed a funeral march that was to become the basis of Part Two, ""Denn alles Fleisch""), but which also incorporates material from a symphony which he started in 1854 but abandoned following Schumann's suicide attempt. He once wrote that the Requiem ""belonged to Schumann"". The first movement of this abandoned symphony was re-worked as the first movement of the First Piano Concerto. Brahms loved the classical composers Mozart and Haydn. He Johannes Brahms especially admired Mozart , so much so that in his final years , he reportedly declared Mozart as the greatest composer . On 10 January 1896, Brahms conducted the Academic Festival Overture and both piano concertos in Berlin, and during the following celebration, Brahms interrupted Joachim's toast with ""Ganz recht; auf Mozart's Wohl"" (Quite right; here's Mozart's health). Brahms also compared Mozart with Beethoven to the latter's disadvantage, in a letter to Richard Heuberger, in 1896: ""Dissonance, true dissonance as Mozart used it, is not to be found in Beethoven. Look at Idomeneo. Not only is it a marvel, but as Mozart was still quite young and brash when he wrote it, it was a completely new thing. You couldn't commission great music from Beethoven since he created only lesser works on commission—his more conventional pieces, his variations and the like."" Brahms collected first editions and autographs of Mozart and Haydn's works and edited performing editions. He studied the music of pre-classical composers, including Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Giovanni Gabrieli, Johann Adolph Hasse, Heinrich Schütz, Domenico Scarlatti, George Frideric Handel, and, especially, Johann Sebastian Bach. His friends included leading musicologists, and, with Friedrich Chrysander, he edited an edition of the works of François Couperin. Brahms also edited works by C. P. E. Bach and W. F. Bach. He looked to older music for inspiration in the art of counterpoint; the themes of some of his works are modelled on Baroque sources such as Bach's The Art of Fugue in the fugal finale of Cello Sonata No. 1 or the same composer's Cantata No. 150 in the passacaglia theme of the Fourth Symphony's finale. Peter Phillips hears affinities between Brahms's rhythmically charged contrapuntal textures and those of Renaissance masters such as Giovanni Gabrieli and William Byrd. Referring to Byrd's Though Amaryllis dance, Philips remarks that ""the cross-rhythms in this piece so excited E. H. Fellowes that he likened them to Brahms's compositional style.""","He especially admired Mozart, so much so that in his final years, he reportedly declared Mozart as the greatest composer.","Johannes Brahms especially admired Mozart, so much so that in his final years, he reportedly declared Mozart as the greatest composer.",t,

Woodrue, sometimes called the Plant Master, uses his advanced botanical knowledge to control plant growth in an attempt to take over the world. He is defeated by the superhero Atom.The Plant Master returns to face the Atom and the Justice League. In Flash #245 (November 1976), Woodrue uses an experimental formula to transform his body into a plant/human hybrid, with his skin resembling bark and his hair turning into leaves. Now calling himself the Floronic Man, he is defeated by Green Lantern. After a rematch with the Atom and Wonder Woman, the Floronic Man later becomes a member of the Secret Society of Super-Villains. In Alan Moore's relaunch of the Swamp Thing in The Saga of the Swamp Thing (vol. 2) #21 (February 1984), Woodrue is hired by General Avery Sunderland to discover how scientist Alec Holland had been turned into the Swamp Thing. Woodrue discovers that the creature, instead of being a mutated version of Holland, is rather an intelligent mass of plant life that had fed on Holland's dead body and absorbed his knowledge and memories. The Floronic Man tries to warn Sunderland that the Swamp Thing is not dead, but the General refuses to listen and announces his intent to terminate Woodrue's employment. Subsequently, the Floronic Man traps Sunderland in his office with a thawed and enraged Swamp Thing, who kills the General. In The Saga of the Swamp Thing (vol. 2) #22 (March 1984), the Floronic Man uses the Swamp Thing's body—now regressing to a plant-like state due to his inability to accept the new revelation about his origins, Woodrue literally eating parts of him—to contact the Green, which is composed of the life force of all plants on Earth.

done,"Sidney Alford [HEAD] Career [SEP] His professional life began as a chemist and, in 1966, he was awarded a doctorate of the University of Paris (mention très honourable) for research on the chemistry of plant products carried out at one of Europe's oldest organic chemistry laboratories in the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle under Professor Charles Mentzer. The following two years at Tokyo and Waseda Universities gave him some understanding of research in Japan and the language respectively. Returning to England in 1969, he joined a tiny company in Piccadilly organising clinical trials of a diet developed for NASA for astronauts. This work brought him into contact with some prominent physicians, pathologists, surgeons and biochemists and one of the latter, Dr (now Professor) Michael Crawford of the Nuffield Institute of Comparative Medicine, offered him a bench in his department which specialised in the study of the chemistry and nutritional implications of fatty acids in the diet. Unable to raise funds sufficient to enable him to continue his research, Alford moved from central London to Ham in its western suburbs. The ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland awoke Alford's interest in explosives and he began to consider more effective means of defeating improvised devices (IEDs) than such devices as rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) with cement-filled warheads. He experimented with the use of elongate gas cylinders, filled with liquid carbon dioxide and provided with an axial tube containing a small explosive charge, as a penetrative disruptor of potentially buried packages. The use of letter bombs by the Black September Organization (BSO), one of which had killed a diplomat in the Israeli embassy in September 1972, led him to develop blast absorbing vermiculite-based containers for small suspect devices which enabled them to be transported in relative safety. These were purported to be the first blast containers of their kind. In 1974 a visit by the Security Service resulted in Alford being offered a job as a part-time conference interpreter by the MoD using his knowledge of both languages and explosives. This helped sustain him and his young family while he studied for an MSc in Environmental Pollution Science at Brunel University. In 1976	the Royal Armaments Research & Development Establishment (RARDE) at Fort Halstead (later to become DSTL) arranged for Wallop Industries (now Wallop Defence Systems) to provide facilities for him to develop one of his inventions, the water lined and water-filled shaped charge, initially made in his house and tested in his garden, in more orthodox surroundings. Alford's findings were ground-breaking at the time, and were some of the first demonstrations of using water-tamped charges for countering the emerging threat from IEDs. Other inventions were made in the course of this research but eventually Alford received a letter, which he keeps with pride, effectively ordering him to stop having any more new ideas since he did not work for Fort Halstead. Undeterred, Alford moved to Wiltshire in the south west of England and joined Leafield Engineering where he continued to develop novel explosive charges but realised that his future did not lie therein when he was told by the head of sales that his devices worked well enough but some of them, because of their novelty, did not look as if they would work. During this time – in June 1978 – Alford was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Explosives Engineers (IExpE). He accepted an invitation to join Hotforge, a small company which provided explosives services to the petroleum industry, and was offered a directorship. He was thus able to devote himself to the development of explosive cutting charges. Sidney Alford designed underwater steel - cutting charges which he used for chain cutting , plate perforating ( using his new trepanning charges ) and well - head severing operations in the North Sea for the petroleum industry . His first experiments using flexible linear fracturing charges which depended upon the collision of shock waves were demonstrated and patented.","Alford designed underwater steel-cutting charges which he used for chain cutting, plate perforating (using his new trepanning charges) and well-head severing operations in the North Sea for the petroleum industry.","Sidney Alford designed underwater steel-cutting charges which he used for chain cutting, plate perforating (using his new trepanning charges) and well-head severing operations in the North Sea for the petroleum industry.",n,Seems to be malformed

They In the board game "" Spirit Island "" , players take the role of Spirits on an island and must drive off the colonizing Invaders , who grow their presence on the island , including founding Towns and Cities , over the course of a game . The core game can be played by 1-4 players, and the Jagged Earth expansion adds support for up to 6 players. Over the course of the game players unlock more abilities for their Spirit and additional Power cards, making them stronger and more capable of pushing back the Invaders. The Invaders' actions are controlled by a deck of cards that dictates the areas of the board they Explore, Build, and ""Ravage"". Any tiles that the players aren't able to protect against the ""Ravage"" action results in a Blight token being added to it. To win the game, players must use their Spirit's powers to clear out the Invaders and their settlements, while also generating Fear, which lowers the criteria to win. The players lose if the Invaders add too many Blight tokens to the board, if one of the Spirits has all its Presence removed from the board, or if the deck of Invader actions runs out. The game contains an array of Spirits - eight in the base game, two in the Branch & Claw expansion, 10 in the Jagged Earth expansion, and two ""Promo Packs"" with two additional Spirits in each - for players to choose from.

imp,"Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine [HEAD] Defending radicals and reformers [SEP] The loss of his parliamentary seat enabled Erskine to concentrate on his legal practice. In 1786, when he was thirty-six years old and had been practising at the Bar for only eight years, he was able to write: ""I continue highly successful in my profession, being now, I may say, as high as I can go at the Bar. The rest depends on politics, which at present are adverse."" Amongst his notable cases in 1780s was his successful defence of William Davies Shipley, dean of St Asaph (and son of Jonathan Shipley) who was tried in 1784 at Shrewsbury for seditious libel for publishing Principles of Government, in a Dialogue between a Gentleman and a Farmer, a tract by his brother-in-law Sir William Jones advancing radical views on the relationship between subjects and the state. Erskine's defence anticipated the Libel Act 1792, which laid down the principle that it is for the jury (who previously had only decided the question of publication) and not the judge to decide whether or not a publication is a libel. In 1789 he was counsel for John Stockdale, a bookseller, who was charged with seditious libel in publishing John Logan's pamphlet in support of Warren Hastings, whose impeachment was then proceeding. Erskine's speech, which resulted in the Stockdale's acquittal, argued that a defendant should not be convicted if his composition, taken as a whole, did not go beyond a free and fair discussion, even if selected passages might be libellous. Henry Brougham considered this to be one of Erskine's finest speeches: ""It is justly regarded, by all English lawyers, as a consummate specimen of the art of addressing a jury"". Three years later he would, against the advice of his friends, take on the defence of Thomas Paine who had been charged with seditious libel after the publication of the second part of his Rights of Man. Paine was tried in his absence; he was in France. Erskine argued for the right of a people to criticise, reform and change its government; he made the point that a free press produces security in the government. But in this case his arguments failed to convince the special jury, who returned a verdict of guilty without even retiring. Erskine's speech is also remembered for a passage on the duty of barristers to take on even unpopular cases: ""I will for ever, at all hazards, assert the dignity, independence, and integrity of the English Bar, without which impartial justice, the most valuable part of the English constitution, can have no existence. From the moment that any advocate can be permitted to say that he will or will not stand between the Crown and the subject arraigned in the court where he daily sits to practise , from that moment the liberties of England are at an end . "" Erskine's decision to defend Paine cost him his position as attorney-general (legal advisor) to the Prince of Wales, to which he had been appointed in 1786.","From the moment that any advocate can be permitted to say that he will or will not stand between the Crown and the subject arraigned in the court where he daily sits to practise, from that moment the liberties of England are at an end.""","From the moment that any advocate can be permitted to say that he will or will not stand between the Crown and the subject arraigned in the court where he daily sits to practise, from that moment the liberties of England are at an end.""",,

un,"Passive ventilation [HEAD] Assessing performance [SEP] While natural ventilation eliminates electrical energy consumed by fans, overall energy consumption of natural ventilation systems is often higher than that of modern mechanical ventilation systems featuring heat recovery. Typical modern mechanical ventilation systems use as little as 2000 J/m3 for fan operation, and in cold weather they can recover much more energy than this in the form of heat transferred from waste exhaust air to fresh supply air using recuperators. Ventilation heat loss can be calculated as: theta=Cp*rho*dT*(1-eta). Theta is ventilation heat loss in W Cp is specific heat capacity of air (~1000 J/(kg*K)) dT is the temperature difference between inside and outside air in °K or °C Eta is the heat recovery efficiency - (typically around 0.8 with heat recovery and 0 if no heat recovery device is used). The temperature differential needed between indoor and outdoor air for mechanical ventilation with heat recovery to outperform natural ventilation in terms of overall energy efficiency can therefore be calculated as: SFP is specific fan power in Pa, J/m^3, or W/(m^3/s) Under typical comfort ventilation conditions with a heat recovery efficiency of 80% and a SFP of 2000 J/m3 we get: dT=2000/(1000*1.2*(1-0.8))=8.33 K In climates where the mean absolute difference between inside and outside temperatures exceeds ~10K the energy conservation argument for choosing natural over mechanical ventilation might therefore be questioned. It should however be noted that heating energy might be cheaper and more environmentally friendly than electricity. This is especially the case in areas where district heating is available. To develop natural ventilation systems with heat recovery two inherent challenges must first be solved: Research aiming at the development of natural ventilation systems featuring heat recovery have been made as early as 1993 where Shultz et al. proposed and tested a chimney type design relying on stack effect while recovering heat using a large counterflow recuperator constructed from corrugated galvanized iron. Both supply and exhaust happened through an unconditioned attic space, with exhaust air being extracted at ceiling height and air being supplied at floor level through a vertical duct. The device was found to provide sufficient ventilation air flow for a single family home and heat recovery with an efficiency around 40%. The device was however found to be too large and heavy to be practical, and the heat recovery efficiency too low to be competitive with mechanical systems of the time. Later attempts have primarily focused on wind as the main driving force due to its higher pressure potential. This however introduces an issue of there being large fluctuations in driving pressure. With the use of wind towers placed on the roof of ventilated spaces , supply and exhaust can be placed close to each other on opposing sides of the small towers . These systems often feature finned heat pipes although this limits the theoretical maximum heat recovery efficiency.","With the use of wind towers placed on the roof of ventilated spaces, supply and exhaust can be placed close to each other on opposing sides of the small towers.","With the use of wind towers placed on the roof of ventilated spaces, supply and exhaust can be placed close to each other on opposing sides of the small towers.",,

Over the following year and a half the magazine published Neal's ""American Writers"" series, which is the first written history of American literature. The relationship between Blackwood and Neal fell apart over Neal's novel Brother Jonathan, which Blackwood published at a loss in late 1825.

imp,"Palawan [HEAD] History and prehistory ; Prehistory [SEP] The early history of Palawan was determined by a team of researchers led by Dr. Robert B. Fox. They found evidence in the Tabon Caves that humans have lived in Palawan for more than 50,000 years. They also found human bone fragments, from an individual known as Tabon Man, in the municipality of Quezon, as well as tools and other artifacts. Two articulated phalanx bones of a tiger, besides another phalanx piece, were found amidst an assemblage of other animal bones and stone tools in Ille Cave near the village of New Ibajay. The other animal fossils were ascribed to macaques, deer, bearded pigs, small mammals, lizards, snakes and turtles. From the stone tools, besides the evidence for cuts on the bones, and the use of fire, it would appear that early humans had accumulated the bones. Additionally, the condition of the tiger subfossils, dated to approximately 12,000 to 9,000 years ago, differed from other fossils in the assemblage, dated to the Upper Paleolithic. The tiger subfossils showed longitudinal fracture of the cortical bone due to weathering, which suggests that they had post-mortem been exposed to light and air. Tiger parts were commonly used as amulets in South and Southeast Asia, so it may be that the tiger parts were imported from elsewhere, as is the case with tiger canine teeth, which were found in Ambangan sites dating to the 10th to 12th centuries in Butuan, Mindanao. On the other hand, the proximity of Borneo and Palawan also makes it likely that the tiger had colonized Palawan from Borneo before the Early Holocene. Using the work of Von den Driesch, all chosen anatomical features of appendicular elements' anatomical features which were chosen, besides molars, were measured to distinguish between taxa that had close relationships, and see morphometric changes over ages, though not for pigs or deer. For the latter two , cranial and mandibular elements , besides teeth of deer from Ille Cave were compared with samples of the Philippine brown deer ( Cervus mariannus ) , Calamian hog deer ( Axis calamianensis ) , and Visayan spotted deer ( Cervus alfredi ) , and thus two taxa of deer have been identified from the fossils : Axis and Cervus . Remains of pigs were compared with the Eurasian (Sus scrofa) and Palawanese wild boar (Sus ahoenobarbus). It is known that the Eurasian wild boar was imported as a domesticate to the islands from mainland Southeast Asia to the islands during the Terminal Holocene. Palawan was a major site for the Maritime Jade Road, one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world, operating for 3,000 years from 2000 BCE to 1000 CE.","For the latter two, cranial and mandibular elements, besides teeth of deer from Ille Cave were compared with samples of the Philippine brown deer (Cervus mariannus), Calamian hog deer (Axis calamianensis), and Visayan spotted deer (Cervus alfredi), and thus two taxa of deer have been identified from the fossils: Axis and Cervus.","For the latter two, cranial and mandibular elements, besides teeth of deer from Ille Cave were compared with samples of the Philippine brown deer (Cervus mariannus), Calamian hog deer (Axis calamianensis), and Visayan spotted deer (Cervus alfredi), and thus two taxa of deer have been identified from the fossils: Axis and Cervus.",,

imp,"Change of rings [HEAD] Operations ; Extension of scalars ; Examples [SEP] One of the simplest examples is complexification, which is extension of scalars from the real numbers to the complex numbers. More generally, given any field extension K < L, one can extend scalars from K to L. In the language of fields, a module over a field is called a vector space, and thus extension of scalars converts a vector space over K to a vector space over L. This can also be done for division algebras, as is done in quaternionification (extension from the reals to the quaternions). More generally, given a homomorphism from a field or commutative ring R to a ring S, the ring S can be thought of as an associative algebra over R, and thus when one extends scalars on an R-module, the resulting module can be thought of alternatively as an S-module, or as an R-module with an algebra representation of S (as an R-algebra). For example, the result of complexifying a real vector space (R = R, S = C) can be interpreted either as a complex vector space (S-module) or as a real vector space with a linear complex structure (algebra representation of S as an R-module). This generalization is useful even for the study of fields – notably, many algebraic objects associated to a field are not themselves fields, but are instead rings, such as algebras over a field, as in representation theory. Just as one can extend scalars on vector spaces, one can also extend scalars on group algebras and also on modules over group algebras, i.e., group representations. Particularly useful is relating how irreducible representations change under extension of scalars – for example, the representation of the cyclic group of order 4, given by rotation of the plane by 90°, is an irreducible 2-dimensional real representation, but on extension of scalars to the complex numbers, it split into 2 complex representations of dimension 1. This corresponds to the fact that the characteristic polynomial of this operator , x 2 + 1 , { \ displaystyle x ^ { 2 } + 1 , } is irreducible of degree 2 over the reals , but factors into 2 factors of degree 1 over the complex numbers – it has no real eigenvalues , but 2 complex eigenvalues .

un,"Meitnerium [HEAD] Experimental chemistry [SEP] Meitnerium is the first element on the periodic table whose chemistry has not yet been investigated. Unambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of meitnerium has yet to have been established due to the short half-lives of meitnerium isotopes and a limited number of likely volatile compounds that could be studied on a very small scale. One of the few meitnerium compounds that are likely to be sufficiently volatile is meitnerium hexafluoride (MtF6), as its lighter homologue iridium hexafluoride (IrF6) is volatile above 60 °C and therefore the analogous compound of meitnerium might also be sufficiently volatile; a volatile octafluoride (MtF8) might also be possible. For chemical studies to be carried out on a transactinide, at least four atoms must be produced, the half-life of the isotope used must be at least 1 second, and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week. Even though the half-life of 278Mt, the most stable confirmed meitnerium isotope, is 4.5 seconds, long enough to perform chemical studies, another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of meitnerium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained. Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the meitnerium isotopes and have automated systems experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of meitnerium, as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements; some of the separation techniques used for bohrium and hassium could be reused. However, the experimental chemistry of meitnerium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory attempted to synthesize the isotope 271Mt in 2002–2003 for a possible chemical investigation of meitnerium because it was expected that it might be more stable than the isotopes around it as it has 162 neutrons , a magic number for deformed nuclei ; its half - life was predicted to be a few seconds , long enough for a chemical investigation . However, no atoms of 271Mt were detected, and this isotope of meitnerium is currently unknown. An experiment determining the chemical properties of a transactinide would need to compare a compound of that transactinide with analogous compounds of some of its lighter homologues: for example, in the chemical characterization of hassium, hassium tetroxide (HsO4) was compared with the analogous osmium compound, osmium tetroxide (OsO4). In a preliminary step towards determining the chemical properties of meitnerium, the GSI attempted sublimation of the rhodium compounds rhodium(III) oxide (Rh2O3) and rhodium(III) chloride (RhCl3). However, macroscopic amounts of the oxide would not sublimate until 1000 °C and the chloride would not until 780 °C, and then only in the presence of carbon aerosol particles: these temperatures are far too high for such procedures to be used on meitnerium, as most of the current methods used for the investigation of the chemistry of superheavy elements do not work above 500 °C.","The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory attempted to synthesize the isotope 271Mt in 2002–2003 for a possible chemical investigation of meitnerium because it was expected that it might be more stable than the isotopes around it as it has 162 neutrons, a magic number for deformed nuclei; its half-life was predicted to be a few seconds, long enough for a chemical investigation.","The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory attempted to synthesize the isotope 271Mt in 2002–2003 for a possible chemical investigation of meitnerium because it was expected that it might be more stable than the isotopes around it as it has 162 neutrons, a magic number for deformed nuclei; its half-life was predicted to be a few seconds, long enough for a chemical investigation.",,

On the Pizzigano brothers' map (1367) and on the Catalan Atlas (1375) a town approximately on the Belaya River was designated Pascherti (Bashkort), and Gerardus Mercator's map (1554) also marked the settlement with the Pascherti name. French orientalist Henri Cordier associates the position of Pascherti with the current location of Ufa. Ibn Khaldun called the town, among the largest cities of the Golden Horde, Bashkort. Russian historian of the 18th century Peter Rychkov wrote that there was a great city on the territory of Ufa before the arrival of the Russians. The official of the Orenburg Governorate government Vasily Rebelensky wrote that Ufa was founded by the Bashkirs. By order of Ivan the Terrible a fortress was built on the site of modern Ufa in 1574, and originally bore the name of the hill it stood on, Tura-Tau. 1574 is now considered to be the official date of Ufa's foundation. Town status was granted to it in 1586. Before becoming the seat of a separate Ufa Governorate in 1781, the city, along with the rest of the Bashkir lands, was under the jurisdiction of the Orenburg governors. And even though the 1796 reform reunited Orenburg and Ufa again, in 1802 the city of Ufa became a new center of the entire Orenburg Governorate that included large territories of modern-day Republic of Bashkortostan, Orenburg Oblast, and Chelyabinsk Oblast. During the 1800-1810s, Scottish Russian architect William Heste developed a general city plan for Ufa as a regional capital shaping the modern outline of its historical center. The Belaya River Waterway (1870) and the Samara-Zlatoust Railroad (1890) connected the city to the European part of the Russian Empire and stimulated development of the city's light industry. As a result, by 1913 the population of Ufa grew to 100,000. During World War II, following eastward Soviet retreat in 1941, the Abwehr operated in Ufa, 1941–1943, some German infiltration, occurred 1914–1943 in espionage, a number of industrial enterprises of the western parts of the Soviet Union were evacuated to Ufa.

un,"History of flower arrangement [HEAD] Ancient China [SEP] The Chinese were making flower arrangements as far back as 207 BCE to 220 CE , in the Han era of ancient China . Flowers were an integral component of religious teaching and medicine. Practitioners of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism placed cut flowers on their altars, a practice which dates back to 618-906 CE. They created paintings, carvings, and embroidered items with depictions of flowers. The paintings can be found on vases, plates, scrolls, and silk, while carvings were done on wood, bronze, jade and ivory. Buddhist teachings forbade the taking of a life, so religious practitioners worked sparingly when taking cuttings from plants. Flowers and leaves that were used to make basket arrangements were selected based on their symbolic meaning. For example, the bamboo, the peach tree, and the pear tree symbolized longevity. The tiger lily, the pomegranate, and the orchid symbolized fertility. The most honored of all flowers was the peony. Considered the “king of flowers”, it symbolized wealth, good fortune, and high status. During the period 500CE to 1453CE, the Byzantine Empire made its contribution to floral arrangements, which typically included a cone shape design.

done,"John Adams [HEAD] Retirement (1801–1826) ; Initial years [SEP] Adams resumed farming at Peacefield in the town of Quincy and began work on an autobiography. The work had numerous gaps and was eventually abandoned and left unedited. Most of Adams's attention was focused on farm work. He regularly worked around the farm but mostly left manual labor to hired hands. His John Quincy Adams ' frugal lifestyle and presidential salary had left him with a considerable fortune by 1801 . In 1803, Bird, Savage & Bird, the bank holding his cash reserves of about $13,000 collapsed. John Quincy resolved the crisis by buying his properties in Weymouth and Quincy, including Peacefield, for $12,800. During the first four years of retirement, Adams made little effort to contact others, but eventually resumed contact with old acquaintances such as Benjamin Waterhouse and Benjamin Rush. Adams generally stayed quiet on public matters. He did not publicly denounce Jefferson's actions as president, believing that ""instead of opposing Systematically any Administration, running down their Characters and opposing all their Measures right or wrong, We ought to Support every Administration as far as We can in Justice."" When a disgruntled James Callender, angry at not being appointed to an office, turned on the president by revealing the Sally Hemings affair, Adams said nothing. John Quincy was elected to the Senate in 1803. Shortly thereafter, both he and his father crossed party lines to support Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase. The only major political incident involving Adams during the Jefferson years was a dispute with Mercy Otis Warren in 1806. Warren, an old friend, had written a history of the American Revolution attacking Adams for his ""partiality for monarchy"" and ""pride of talents and much ambition."" A tempestuous correspondence ensued. In time, their friendship healed. Adams did privately criticize the President over his Embargo Act, despite the fact that John Quincy voted for it. John Quincy resigned from the Senate in 1808 after the Federalist-controlled State Senate refused to nominate him for a second term. After the Federalists denounced John Quincy as no longer being of their party, Adams wrote to him that he himself had long since ""abdicated and disclaimed the name and character and attributes of that sect."" After Jefferson's retirement from public life in 1809, Adams became more vocal. He published a three-year marathon of letters in the Boston Patriot newspaper, refuting line-by-line Hamilton's 1800 pamphlet. The initial piece was written shortly after his return from Peacefield and ""had gathered dust for eight years."" Adams had decided to shelve it over fears that it could negatively impact John Quincy should he ever seek office. Although Hamilton had died in 1804 in a duel with Aaron Burr, Adams felt the need to vindicate his character against his charges. With his son having broken from the Federalist Party and joined the Republicans, he felt he could safely do so without threatening his political career. Adams supported the War of 1812. Having worried over the rise of sectionalism, he celebrated the growth of a ""national character"" that accompanied it. Adams supported James Madison for reelection to the presidency in 1812. Daughter Abigail (""Nabby"") was married to Representative William Stephens Smith, but she returned to her parents' home after the failure of the marriage; she died of breast cancer in 1813.",His frugal lifestyle and presidential salary had left him with a considerable fortune by 1801.,John Quincy Adams' frugal lifestyle and presidential salary had left him with a considerable fortune by 1801.,t,

The glaciers that feed the river are Grovabreen, Jostefonn, and Troget, all three are located just west of the massive Jostedalsbreen glacier. The Gaula river starts up in the mountains and empties into a fjord at sea level , and so the water drops over 700 metres ( 2 , 300 ft ) in elevation throughout its course . This is one reason why the area is often referred to as Fosselandet (lit. ""the land of waterfalls""). There are many waterfalls on the Gaular and its tributaries. The river Gaula begins as two main branches. The northern branch begins in the mountains east of the village of Haukedalen in Førde Municipality. That branch flows to the southwest eventually into the lake Viksdalsvatnet. The southern branch begins at the lake Norddalsvatnet on the border of the municipalities of Sunnfjord and Sogndal. It flows along the border, then south into Sogndal to the lake Nystølsvatnet. The river then turns west, back into Sunnfjord municipality and it heads west until it empties into the lake Viksdalsvatnet. This lake is where the two branches join together.

un,"Dingolfing [HEAD] History [SEP] The area now called Dingolfing was first mentioned in Tinguluinga in the year 833. In the year 1251 the duke of Bavaria, Otto II. awarded municipal rights to the town, which was the Upper City. The Lower City, around the church of St. John's, was an older settlement belonging to the Prince-Bishopric of Regensburg. By treaty of 1265 between Duke and Bishop, both cities were united. Dingolfing's large growth took place during the years of about 1315 to 1600. During this time the city prospered mostly through trade, fishing, leather craft and the production of wool cloths. The duke promoted these works, causing Dingolfing to prosper even more. The war of Austrian succession caused very heavy damage to the city and decimated the population by epidemics. The city became nothing more than debris and ash on May 16, 1743 after being fired upon by Austrian troops. Greater parts of the city were burnt in a large fire. Many of the town's records were destroyed in this fire. Between 1802 and 1803 the local courts were dissolved. Between 1816 and 1817 there were many economic and harvest failures. There was also a period of large price increases. This period is thought to be the lowest point in the long history of the city. A railroad track leading from Munich to Prague and many new roads were built in the mid - 19th century , which began a major turn - around for the city . Many new industries formed in Dingolfing around this time too. The region began to paint a new picture of itself. In 1905 a new machine shop opened to repair broken farming equipment. After the Second World War this shop changed its business and began producing scooters and automobiles. In the 1950s the plant began producing automobiles under the Glas car company. BMW bought the facility in 1967. Known today as BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, the plant produces the 3 Series GT, the 4 Series, the 5 Series, the M5, the 6 Series GT, the 7 Series and the 8 Series. With 330,000 vehicles made in 2018, the Dingolfing plant has the highest production volume of any BMW plant in Europe. After 1945 and especially since the 1970s Dingolfing intensified its investments in its urban infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, and housing for the elderly.","A railroad track leading from Munich to Prague and many new roads were built in the mid-19th century, which began a major turn-around for the city.","A railroad track leading from Munich to Prague and many new roads were built in the mid-19th century, which began a major turn-around for the city.",,
done,"South Holland [HEAD] Geography [SEP] South Holland covers an area of 3,403 km2 (1,314 sq mi), of which 585 km2 (226 sq mi) is water. It borders the North Sea to the west, North Holland to the north, Utrecht and Gelderland to the east, and North Brabant and Zeeland to the south. Beside the dunes along the North Sea coast, the province is almost entirely flat and mostly consists of polders. The centre of South Holland and the area along the coast in the west are largely urban, part of the Randstad conurbation, while the east of the province is more agrarian and belongs to the Groene Hart, literally Green Heart. The south of the province is a collection of islands in the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta. For census reasons, South Holland is divided into four regions: Rijnmond, South, West and East. The Duin- en Bollenstreek is a region in the north-west of South Holland, around Katwijk, that features coastal dunes and the cultivation of flower bulbs. To the south of the region lie mostly pastures on sand soil, that form the transition to more urban area. This urban area runs along the Old Rhine, from Katwijk via Rijnsburg to Leiden and Zoeterwoude-Rijndijk. South of Leiden and north of The Hague lies an area where a landscape of dunes bordering the North Sea in the west transitions to one of peat more to the east. The easternmost tip of South Holland is part of De Biesbosch, one of the largest national parks of the Netherlands and one of the last freshwater tide areas in Europe. Other parks in South Holland, although no national parks, include Delftse Hout east of Delft, Ackerdijkse Plassen, a bird reserve north of Rotterdam, and Buytenpark and Westerpark near Zoetermeer. The Kagerplassen are a collection of lakes north-east of Leiden, popular for boating, watersports, fishing, camping and walking. The southern part of South Holland consists of a number of islands of the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta. Although technically islands in the sense that they are surrounded by rivers, canals or other bodies of water, most of these islands are well connected to the rest of the province via bridges, tunnels and dams. The southern islands of South Holland , most notably Goeree - Overflakkee ( 1 on the map ) , Tiengemeten ( 2 ) , Hoeksche Waard ( 6 ) and Voorne - Putten ( 4 / 5 ) , are largely agrarian , while more to the north , the islands are more urban , such as Dordrecht ( 7 ) , IJsselmonde ( 9 ) and Rozenburg ( 10 ) , while other islands , like Rozenburg ( 10 ) , are mostly used for petrochemical industry . Together, these cities form the Rijnmond conurbation, centred on the city of Rotterdam. Together with Haaglanden (centred on The Hague) and Delfland (centred on Delft) in the north, and the Drechtsteden to the south-east, this conurbation in turn forms the South Wing of the Randstad conurbation, which spans across South Holland, North Holland and Utrecht. Other regions in South Holland include Alblasserwaard, Gouwestreek (""The Gouwe Area""), Hoeksche Waard, Krimpenerwaard, Rijnland (""Rhineland""), Rijnstreek (""The Rhine Area""), Vijfheerenlanden and Westland (roughly including Hook of Holland and the municipalities of Westland and Midden-Delfland).

By using photometry the transit of a planet in front of its star can be seen as a dip in the light curve of the star. After the initial discovery the five innermost planets have all been confirmed through additional investigations. Kepler-80b and Kepler-80c were both confirmed in 2013 based on their transit-timing variation (TTV). Kepler-80d and Kepler-80e were validated in 2014 based on statistical analysis of the Kepler data. Finally the innermost planet, Kepler-80f was confirmed in 2016. All six known planets in the Kepler-80 system orbit very close to the star, and their distances to the star (the semi-major axes are all smaller than 0.2 AU). For comparison the planet in the Solar System closest to the star, Mercury, has a semi major axis of 0.389 AU, and so the entire known system of Kepler-80 can lie within the orbit of Mercury.

done,"William Frank Carver [HEAD] Carver versus Bogardus [SEP] Almost from the beginning of his shooting career, Carver issued challenges to Captain Adam Henry Bogardus, who was recognized across the country and around the world as the champion trap shooter. Bogardus was Carver's senior by seventeen years, however, and had little to gain and much to lose by accepting a challenge from the newcomer. In 1879 Carver set sail for a tour of Europe, where he shot in numerous exhibitions and matches, using shotgun, rifle, and pistol and shooting from horseback or from foot. He performed for ordinary citizens and for nobility, the most notable being the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII). He traveled to France, Belgium, Germany, and Austria, but most of the tour was in the British Isles, where he was booked for a long-term engagement at the Crystal Palace, in the wealthy Sydenham Hill district of London. Regardless of the considerable success he was having in Europe, the desire to stage a match with the great Bogardus was ever-present. So anxious was Carver to shoot against Bogardus that in 1881, in a challenge printed in the London Sportsman, he offered to pay $250 toward expenses if Bogardus would travel to London for a match. Bogardus ignored this challenge. William Frank Carver returned to the United States in the fall of 1882 and again threw down the gauntlet . Early in 1883 Bogardus finally agreed to a live pigeon shoot in Louisville, Kentucky. The proposed match created much excitement in the shooting world, and a crowd of nearly 1000 gathered to watch two of the world's finest shooters compete. The Louisville Commercial ran the following article on February 21, 1883: Captain A. H. Bogardus, the champion shot, arrived in the city yesterday morning, and immediately repaired to the Louisville Hotel, where his rival, Dr. Carver is stopping. Neither of them ""recognized"" the other, although they met several times during the morning and dined at adjoining tables. Captain Bogardus remarked to a friend in a fatherly way that the ""young 'un"" seemed to be in fine form, and Dr. Carver was overheard saying as he blushed before a plate of potato salad, that ""the old man was looking pretty well himself."" Once or twice they glared politely at each other, and the scene was rather amusing. Captain Bogardus would transfix a baked apple with his fork, and then cast a quick glance at Carver, who at that moment was sipping his ox-tail soup, timidly eyeing the Captain over the rim of the bowl. Carver won the match 83 to 82, giving Bogardus the nudge needed to issue a challenge for further matches. In Chicago, Illinois, they shot two matches, one at live birds and one at clay pigeons, Carver winning both matches. From there they traveled to St. Louis, Missouri, where they found a message waiting for them from the Ligowsky Clay Pigeon Company. If they used Ligowsky's clay pigeons, the company would award a $7500 purse for the series of 25 matches. The match using clay pigeons that they had already shot in Chicago was counted as one match, another match was shot while they were in St. Louis, and from there they traveled to 23 more cities. Carver won 19 of the 25 matches and secured his position as one of the world's best marksmen.",Carver returned to the United States in the fall of 1882 and again threw down the gauntlet.,William Frank Carver returned to the United States in the fall of 1882 and again threw down the gauntlet.,t,

This was a decrease from the previous episode, ""Believe in the Stars"", which was watched by 8.0 million American viewers. This episode was the tenth highest-rated show on the NBC network during the week of November 10–16, 2008. Jennifer Aniston received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards for her work in this episode, but lost to Tina Fey for her satirical portrayal of Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live. Since airing, ""The One with the Cast of Night Court"" has received mixed reception from television critics. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote that the episode was ""kooky, ooky and over-the-top"" and enjoyed every minute of it. ""For the more esoteric viewer, it's a milestone episode"", said The Age's Farah Farouque. Cameron Adams for the Herald Sun called the episode hilarious, while The Boston Globe's Matthew Gilbert felt that it was flaccid and clichéd. IGN contributor Robert Canning said that the episode ""did have its moments"" and that the storylines ""had their potential, and their share of laughs, but I can't help but feel they both could have been so much more."" He opined that the Kenneth and Tracy story was ""more up 30 Rock's style"" but that it was a shame that the story could not ""quite knock the concept out of the park."" Overall , Robert Canning rated "" The One with the Cast of Night Court "" a 7 . 9 out of 10 . Jeff Labrecque for Entertainment Weekly reported that the episode fell flat. Critical opinion was divided on Aniston's performance as Claire. TV Guide's Matt Mitovich wrote that Aniston ""looked sweet, but the role was juuuuust a bit much ... [and] over-the-top."" Jeremy Medina of Paste said that the show did not really seem to know what to do with Aniston in this episode. Tom Stempel for Slant Magazine said 30 Rock was ""smart enough"" not to make Claire resemble Aniston's former television character, Rachel, from Friends. Further in his review, Stempel said that Claire was a ""great choice of character"" for Aniston to play, and praised her for knocking the role ""out of the park."" Kerrie Murphy for The Australian was equally positive noting that Aniston fits in smoothly as Liz's former roommate. Murphy added, ""Not only is it a reminder that Aniston is a gifted comic actor [...] With her, the show's regular cast easily hold their own.""

done,"Henderson Gleaner [HEAD] History [SEP] The Gleaner was founded by Clarence Christian Givens in 1883 in Providence, Kentucky, approximately 35 miles south of Henderson. Givens remained there for six months, then moved his newspaper farther south to Madisonville, Kentucky. In July 1885, Givens relocated the newspaper to Henderson. It became a daily publication in 1888, with the exception that it produced no Monday edition, and was published as the Henderson Morning Gleaner. The Gleaner was not the city's first newspaper; The Columbian was first published in 1823, and the Henderson Reporter was in print from 1853 to 1885. At least a dozen other newspapers have also operated in Henderson at various times, but few copies of those papers have survived. The Henderson Morning Gleaner competed with the Henderson Evening Journal for several years. By 1909, the Evening Journal was losing $500 a week and had been taken over by its bank. Leigh Harris of Illinois, bought the Journal, and his first editorial consisted of the single sentence: ""I have come to Henderson to run a newspaper"". In around 1920, Harris and the Givens family negotiated a merger of the Gleaner and Journal, creating the Henderson Gleaner and Journal. The word "" Journal "" was dropped from the masthead of The Henderson Gleaner in 1973 . Harris later bought out C. C. Givens altogether, becoming the city's sole newspaper publisher. Harris chaired numerous Henderson causes and committees, including serving as chairman of the local American Red Cross chapter during the Ohio River flood of 1937. Henderson was one of the few cities along the Ohio River that escaped the floodwaters of 1937, owing to its position on a bluff well above the river. Harris noted in the newspaper that Henderson was ""on the Ohio but never in it"", using that as a marketing tool as he and other prominent citizens worked to attract new industries to the city. After Harris' death in 1955, his family leased the newspaper to J. Albert Dear of Jersey City, New Jersey. His company, Dear Publication and Radio Inc., bought the newspaper outright two years later. In 1960, the Dear family sent a son, Walter Dear II, to Henderson to serve as promotions manager. He became editor in 1963 and later served as publisher. Dear promoted the community, and was among the city's primary fundraisers for community improvements such as a new YMCA building, a Fine Arts Center on the Henderson Community College campus, a new Salvation Army center and other projects. When the newspaper dropped the word ""Journal"" from its masthead on April 27, 1973, it also changed the print to lower case, as ""the gleaner"". It renamed so until August 10, 1997, when the name returned to upper case, as ""The Gleaner."" The newspaper constructed a new office and printing plant at 455 Klutey Park Plaza in the city suburbs, relocating there in 1976. In 1986, Walt and Martha Dear and their children bought The Gleaner, several other western Kentucky weekly newspapers, and a small radio station in Franklin, Kentucky, from the rest of their family. They later also acquired the Union County Advocate in Morganfield, Kentucky. In 1997, the Dear family sold The Gleaner and other media holdings to the A. H. Belo Corp., a Texas media company that owns The Dallas Morning News. Belo had purchased The Messenger-Inquirer in nearby Owensboro a year earlier. Belo subsequently decided that the two Kentucky newspapers were not core to their business of operating newspapers and television stations in larger high-growth markets, particularly in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest.","The word ""Journal"" was dropped from the masthead in 1973.","The word ""Journal"" was dropped from the masthead of The Henderson Gleaner in 1973.",n,should have been 'Henderson Gleaner and Journal'
done,"William Sayle [HEAD] Settlement of the Bahamas [SEP] William Sayle established the first English settlement of the Bahamas between 1646 and 1648 on the island of Eleuthera, establishing England's claim to the Bahamas archipelago. He left Bermuda with seventy settlers, mostly Bermudians and some English, who were looking for a place where they could worship God freely. To this end they settled on the Island of Segatoo which they gave the name Eleuthera, from the Greek word meaning freedom. This settlement was planned and authorised from England, and did not result from Bermuda's internal strife. As England's first trans-Atlantic colony to become self-sustaining, Bermuda had been important in supporting the establishment of other English colonies in North America and the west Indies, and the settlement of the Bahamas was to take place from the Bermuda, rather than directly from England. Many of the settlers were, in fact, driven out of Bermuda by intolerance and persecution resulting from the Civil War. In 1644, Bermudian Independent Puritans had sent an expedition to explore the Bahamas, but one vessel was lost and the other failed to find a suitable island. The exact dates and circumstances of Sayle's voyage are uncertain. Some sources say that Sayle first left Bermuda in 1646, however, Sayle and his Eleutheran Adventurers did not agree on their ""Articles and Orders of Incorporation"" until 9 July 1647. Perhaps Sayle made at least two voyages, for in a letter of March 1646, William Rener of Bermuda writes to John Winthrop of Massachusetts to report that of two ships recently sailed to the Bahamas, one had been lost and one returned to Bermuda without having found the Bahamas. Rener also mentions that he and Sayle had purchased half interest in a ship, the William, for the purpose of sailing to the Bahamas. In any case, Sayle took seventy people to settle at some point between spring 1646 and autumn 1648. The victorious Royalist Government of Bermuda subsequently ordered two other Cromwellian ministers, and sixty of their followers, to emigrate to the Bahamas. Sayle's legal claim to proprietorship in the Bahamas now seems questionable. In 1646, Sayle, then of Bermuda, claimed to have a grant from the English Parliament to the island of Sagatos, Bahamas, but no record of this grant can be found in The Journal of the House of Commons. However, on 31 August 1649 The Journal does record that ""An Act for Settling the Islands in the West Indies betwixt the Degrees of Twenty-four and Twenty-nine North Latitude was passed."" Though the Act does not mention William Sayle specifically, a letter from lawyer John Bolles dated 15 August 1654 refers to an act passed in 1650 ""for encouragement of adventurers to some newly discovered Islands"", and Bolles mentions ""William Saile"" as one of the twenty-six proprietors. Authorisation, then, may have come after the fact. Sayles was the only one of the twenty-six proprietors to settle in the Bahamas, and he tried to exercise propriety rights over the island much of his life. The difficulties of frontier life and of internal conflicts were not fertile ground for a democracy. On the voyage to the Bahamas , a Captain Butler , one of the settlers from England , rebelled against the Articles and caused such trouble in the new settlement that William Sayle left the original settlement in north Eleuthera for the nearby island of St . George ' s Cay , now known as Spanish Wells . In 1657, Sayle returned to Bermuda, and in 1658, he was re-appointed Governor (he was first appointed Deputy Governor and Captain General on 30 June), a position he lost in 1662, when he was appointed to the Council of Bermuda.","On the voyage to the Bahamas, a Captain Butler, one of the settlers from England, rebelled against the Articles and caused such trouble in the new settlement that William Sayle left the original settlement in north Eleuthera for the nearby island of St. George's Cay, now known as Spanish Wells.","On the voyage to the Bahamas, a Captain Butler, one of the settlers from England, rebelled against the Articles and caused such trouble in the new settlement that William Sayle left the original settlement in north Eleuthera for the nearby island of St. George's Cay, now known as Spanish Wells.",y,no actual change

Life aboard Texas Tower 2 was difficult. Both the structure and its crew suffered from the near-constant vibration caused by rotating radar antennas and diesel generators. The surrounding ocean and tower footings also transmitted distant sounds along the steel legs, amplifying them throughout the entire structure.

un,"Official scorer [HEAD] Responsibilities ; Rule 10.01 [SEP] The rules of baseball require that the official scorer views the game only from the press box , for two basic reasons . First, this ensures that every scorer has nearly the same perspective of the game. One of the intentions of this rule is to improve consistency in scorekeeping decisions between different official scorers working on different games at the same stadium, and between scorers in different stadiums. Second, the press box is the most neutral position within the stadium. Seated in the press box, the official scorer is surrounded by writers and broadcasters who are ostensibly neutral, and the scorer is less likely to be unduly influenced by the players, the coaches, and the crowd. Rule 10.01 states that the scorer is never allowed to make scorekeeping decisions that conflict with the official rules governing scorekeeping. The official scorer is permitted to view available replays and to solicit the opinions of others, but the official scorer is given the sole authority to make the judgment calls that are required in the score report. When a judgment call is made, the official scorer is obligated to immediately communicate that decision to the media in the press box and to the broadcasters, usually through a microphone. The official scorer has up to 24 hours to reconsider or reverse a judgment call that was made during the game. In rare circumstances, MLB's scoring committee may reverse a scoring decision that is ""clearly erroneous"". Finally, within 36 hours of a game's conclusion (including the conclusion of a suspended game), the official scorer is required to create a summary of the game using a form established by the league. This task is performed for each game that is scored, including called games which must be completely replayed at a later date, and games that end in forfeit. The information in the score report includes the date, location of the game, the names of the teams, the names of the umpires who officiated the game, the final score, and the data that is required in rule 10.02.","The rules of baseball require that the official scorer views the game only from the press box, for two basic reasons.","The rules of baseball require that the official scorer views the game only from the press box, for two basic reasons.",,

done,"Ski [HEAD] Etymology and usage [SEP] The word ski comes from the Old Norse word skíð which means ""cleft wood"", ""stick of wood"" or ""ski"". In Old Norse common phrases describing skiing were fara á skíðum (to travel, move fast on skis), renna (to move swiftly) and skríða á skíðum (to stride on skis). In modern Norwegian the word ski has largely retained the Old Norse meaning in words for split firewood, wood building materials (such as bargeboards) and roundpole fence. In Norwegian this word is usually pronounced [ˈʂiː]. In Swedish, another language evolved from Old Norse, the word is skidor (plural, pronounced [ˈɧîːdʊr]; singular: skida). English and French use the original Norwegian spelling ski, and modify the pronunciation. Before 1920 , English often called them skis skee and snow - shoe . In Italian, it is pronounced similarly to Norwegian, but the spelling is modified accordingly: sci [ˈʃi]. Portuguese and Spanish adapt the word to their linguistic rules: esqui and esquí. In German, spellings Ski and Schi are in use, both pronounced [ˈʃiː]. In Dutch, the word is ski and the pronunciation was originally [ˈʃiː] as in Norwegian, but since approximately the 1960s changed to [ˈskiː]. In Welsh the word is spelled sgi. Many languages make a verb form out of the noun, such as to ski in English, skier in French, esquiar in Spanish and Portuguese, sciare in Italian, skiën in Dutch, or Schi laufen or Schi fahren (as above also Ski laufen or Ski fahren) in German. Norwegian and Swedish do not form a verb from the noun. Finnish has its own ancient words for skis and skiing: ""ski"" is suksi and ""skiing"" is hiihtää. The word suksi goes back to the Proto-Uralic period, with cognates such as Erzya soks, Mansi tåut and Nganasan tuta. The Sami also have their own words for ""skis"" and ""skiing"": for example, the Lule Sami word for ""ski"" is sabek and skis are called sabega. The Sami use cuoigat for the verb ""to ski"" (the term may date back to 10,000 years before present).","Before 1920, English often called them skee and snow-shoe.","Before 1920, English often called skis skee and snow-shoe.",,

But Karnataka felt that this was impractical due to the drought conditions prevailing because of the failed monsoon. Karnataka then walked out of the high-level meeting as a sign of protest. On 21 September, Karnataka filed a petition before the Cauvery River Authority seeking review of its 19 September ruling. On 28 September 2012, the Supreme Court slammed the Karnataka government for failing to comply with the directive of the Cauvery River Authority. Left with no other option, Karnataka started releasing water. This led to wide protests and violence in Karnataka. On 4 October 2012, the Karnataka government filed a review petition before the Supreme Court seeking a stay on its 28 September order directing it to release 9,000 cusecs of Cauvery water everyday to Tamil Nadu, until 15 October. On 6 October 2012, several Kannada organisations, under the banner of ""Kannada Okkoota"", called a Karnataka bandh (close down) on 6 October in protest against the Cauvery water release. On 8 October , the Supreme Court of India announced the release of 9 , 000 cusecs had to be continued and it was up to the Cauvery River Authority ' s head , the Prime Minister , as a responsible person , to ensure this happened . The Prime Minister ruled out a review of the Cauvery River Authority’s decision until 20 October, rejecting the plea by both the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party leaders from Karnataka. Within a few hours, Karnataka stopped release of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu made a fresh plea in the Supreme Court on 17 October, reiterating its demand for appropriate directions to be issued to Karnataka to make good the shortfall of 48 TMC of water as per the distress sharing formula. On 15 November 2012, The Cauvery Monitoring Committee directed the Karnataka government to release 4.81 TMC to Tamil Nadu between 16 and 30 November.

The term Kapardaka Purana is seen as a medium of exchange in the writings of the Sena kings and other contemporary kings. Karpadak means cow; And 'Purana' is definitely a kind of silver coin. The conjunction ‘kapardaka-purana’ refers to a medium of exchange whose quality is equal to that of a purana or silver coin (56.6 grains), but which is actually calculated by the proportional denominator. The table found in the traditional arithmetic of Bengal contained 1260 cowries instead of one silver coin (Purana or Dramma). That is, the ratio of Purana and Kapardaka is 1: 1280. Reliable evidence of the widespread use of cowrie in early medieval Bengal has been found in excavations at Paharpur and Kalgang (Bihar near Bhagalpur). Early medieval Bengal saw the scarcity of precious coins and the widespread circulation of cowries.

With the assassination of former general and President-elect Alvaro Obregón in 1928, former general and out-going President of Mexico, Plutarco Elías Calles, founded a political party, the Partido Nacional Revolutionario (PNR), to solve the immediate political crisis of the assassination and to create a long term framework for political stability, especially the transition of presidential regimes. Excluded from the party Partido Nacional Revolutionario were labor and peasants . Under President Lázaro Cárdenas (1934–40) the party underwent a transformation to the Partido de la Revolución Mexicana, which was organized on a corporate basis, with peasants, labor, the popular sector, and the military each having a sector, with power centralized. The PRM aimed to mediate conflicts between competing sectors within the party. The party became an extension of the Mexican state. In 1946, the party was transformed into the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and the army was no longer a sector.

The bill came after Calgary (1946 and 1947), and Edmonton (1946) held municipal plebiscites which approved the move to daylight savings time. Alberta's urban municipalities were in favour of daylight savings time and pressured the provincial government to hold a plebiscite or provide the authority for municipalities to locally observe daylight savings time. A joint motion of Calgary City Council and Edmonton City Council for a plebiscite was put to the Legislature in July 1963, with the support of Social Credit Minister and Edmonton Alderman Ethel Sylvia Wilson, without success. A further effort in March 1964 by Liberal MLA and Calgary Alderman Bill Dickie to allow for a municipal plebiscite on the issue also failed in the Legislature, with Social Credit MLA William Patterson describing daylight savings time as ""that fandangled thing"", and Minister Allen Russell Patrick stating municipal daylight savings time would be difficult for tourists to understand. After a motion introduced by Bill Dickie was approved by the Legislature in February 1966 to hold a plebiscite on daylight savings time, the government responded on March 29, 1966, Minister Alfred Hooke introduced An Act to amend The Daylight Savings Time Act (Bill 75) which amended the Daylight Savings Time Act to permit the government to hold a plebiscite on the issue. On April 17, 1967 the Government of Alberta approved Order-in-Council 607/67 which provided the instructions for the plebiscite on daylight savings time.

done,"Palestinian fedayeen [HEAD] History ; 1948 to 1956 [SEP] Palestinian immigration into Israel first emerged among the Palestinian refugees of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, living in camps in Jordan (including the Jordanian-occupied West Bank), Lebanon, Egypt (including the Egyptian protectorate in Gaza), and Syria. Initially, most infiltrations were economic in nature, with Palestinians crossing the border seeking food or the recovery of property lost in the 1948 war. Between 1948 and 1955, immigration by Palestinians into Israel was opposed by Arab governments, in order to prevent escalation into another war. The problem of establishing and guarding the demarcation line separating the Gaza Strip from the Israeli-held Negev area proved vexing, largely due to the presence of over 200,000 Palestinian Arab refugees in this Gaza area. The terms of the Armistice Agreement restricted Egypt's use and deployment of regular armed forces in the Gaza strip. In keeping with this restriction, the Egyptian Government's solution was to form a Palestinian para-military police force. The Palestinian Border police was created in December 1952. The Border police were placed under the command of 'Abd-al-Man'imi 'Abd-al-Ra'uf, a former Egyptian air brigade commander, member of the Muslim Brotherhood and member of the Revolutionary Council. 250 Palestinian volunteers started training in March 1953, with further volunteers coming forward for training in May and December 1953. Some Border police personnel were attached to the Military Governor's office, under 'Abd-al-'Azim al-Saharti, to guard public installations in the Gaza strip. After an Israeli raid on an Egyptian military outpost in Gaza in February 1955, during which 37 Egyptian soldiers were killed, the Egyptian government began to actively sponsor fedayeen raids into Israel. The first struggle by Palestinian fedayeen may have been launched from Syrian territory in 1951, though most counterattacks between 1951 and 1953 were launched from Jordanian territory. According to Yeshoshfat Harkabi (former head of Israeli military intelligence), these early infiltrations were limited ""incursions"", initially motivated by economic reasons, such as Palestinians crossing the border into Israel to harvest crops in their former villages. Gradually, they developed into violent robbery and deliberate 'terrorist' attacks as fedayeen replaced the 'innocent' refugees as the perpetrators. In 1953, Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion tasked Ariel Sharon, then security chief of the Northern Region, with setting up of a new commando unit, Unit 101, designed to respond to fedayeen infiltrations (see retribution operations). After one month of training, ""a patrol of the unit that infiltrated into the Gaza Strip as an exercise, encountered Palestinians in al-Bureij refugee camp, opened fire to rescue itself and left behind about 30 killed Arabs and dozens of wounded."" In its five-month existence, Unit 101 was also responsible for carrying out the Qibya massacre on the night of 14–15 October 1953, in the Jordanian village of the same name. Cross-border operations by Israel were conducted in both Egypt and Jordan ""to 'teach' the Arab leaders that the Israeli government saw them as responsible for these activities, even if they had not directly conducted them."" Moshe Dayan felt that retaliatory action by Israel was the only way to convince Arab countries that, for the safety of their own citizens, they should work to stop fedayeen infiltrations.

imp,"Operation Red Dog [HEAD] Mission [SEP] On April 27, 1981, Droege and eight other men, including Canadian James Alexander McQuirter and American Don Black, who later founded the white nationalist website Stormfront, were arrested by federal agents in New Orleans as they prepared to board a boat with automatic weapons, shotguns, rifles, handguns, dynamite, ammunition, and a black and white Nazi flag. The plan was to charter a boat to Dominica and rendezvous via rubber boats with Patrick John and his makeshift army. The genesis of the idea came from long-time Klan member Perdue, who was introduced in 1979 to Droege. That summer, Perdue outlined his plan to overthrow the government of Grenada and set up several lucrative businesses. After their meeting, it was established that Droege would locate funds and resources. Croatian-Canadian Don Andrews was initially involved, but after Perdue changed the target island to Dominica, Andrews withdrew. Klansmen Arnie Polli and Roger Dermee were paid US$3,000 to visit Dominica and make a preliminary reconnaissance. German-Canadian neo-Nazi Martin K. Weiche was allegedly a financial backer of the plot along with James White of Houston and L. E. Matthews of Jackson, Mississippi. In February 1981, the captain and crew backed out. Perdue then approached a local boat captain and Vietnam War veteran, Michael S. Howell. Perdue said that the Central Intelligence Agency needed his boat for a covert operation. Howell then contacted the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF). On April 25, John was arrested in Dominica. When Perdue learned of the arrest and that their plans were no longer secret, he insisted that the mission should continue. On April 27, the group, including three ATF agents, met at the predetermined location, loaded the van and proceeded to the marina. Local police were waiting for them at the marina. In 1984, during an interview by Barbados's daily Nation Newspaper, Sydney Burnett-Alleyne, one of the leaders of the plot, was asked if the group had planned to overthrow the government of Barbados and install John as prime minister there as well. He responded: He could have become prime minister, although that was not the real reason behind my plan of action. I wanted to add the land mass of Dominica to that of Barbados and also to be able to undertake an industrial project of considerable size.

Although Sylvia encourages her child to act “normal”, after she is dropped off, Eddie makes a last-minute decision to wear lipstick.

However, after talking to a counselor at the Gender Identity Project and coming home to find Eddie in tears over being “a freak”, Sylvia has a moment of acceptance and tells Eddie that they need to get her waterproof mascara. At school, a friendly girl named Lisa White compliments Eddie's makeup, and she introduces herself as Gwen for the first time. At the trial, the defense attorney asks Lisa questions about Gwen.

It was founded in 1844. The organisation grew into the second largest of the German state railways (after that of the Prussian state railways) with a railway network of 8,526 kilometres (including the Palatinate Railway or Pfalzbahn) by the end of the First World War. Following the abdication of the Bavarian monarchy at the end of the First World War, the 'Royal' title was dropped and on 24 April 1920 the Bavarian State Railway (Bayerische Staatseisenbahn), as it was now called, was merged into the newly formed German Reich Railways Authority or Deutsche Reichseisenbahnen as the Bavarian Group Administration (Gruppenverwaltung Bayern). The management of the Bavarian railway network was divided into four Reichsbahn divisions: Augsburg, Munich, Nuremberg and Regensburg. The former Palatinate Railway formed the Ludwigshafen division. On 1 October 1933 the only group administration within the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft, the Gruppenverwaltung Bayern, was disbanded. As a nation-state, Germany did not come into being until the creation of the German Empire in 1871 from the various German-speaking states such as Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Baden and Württemberg. By then each of the major states had formed its own state railway and these remained separate, albeit working increasingly closely together, until after the First World War. After 1815 the territory of Bavaria included the Palatinate , or Pfalz , which was west of the Rhine and bordered on France and became part of the newly formed German state of Rhineland - Palatinate in 1946 .

The young Duke of Berwick, a future Marshal of France who was present, disapproved, writing at the end of his life ""A more appalling spectacle has never been seen, and nothing else comes as close to the sack of Troy."" The action was widely condemned throughout Europe, as it contravened an accepted convention of siege warfare, i.e. bombardments were used to smash a city's defenses, or destroy military infrastructure, rather than simply targeting the civilian population. Ministers of the Grand Alliance met in The Hague and vowed to avenge Brussels' destruction. The bombardment failed to divert the Allies from Namur, which surrendered on September 5 but caused considerable harm to the reputation of Louis XIV; Napoleon would later deem the bombardment ""as barbarous as it was useless"". However , it It has been suggested the Bombardment of Brussels marked a fundamental shift in military tactics , where taking or holding fortifications had become the dominant form of warfare in this the period .

imp,"Tissue nanotransfection [HEAD] Technique [SEP] Tissue nanotransfection uses custom fabricated nanochannel arrays for nanoscale delivery of genetic cargo directly onto the surface of the skin. The postage stamp-sized chip is placed directly on the skin and an electric current is induced lasting for milliseconds to deliver the gene cargo with precise control. This approach delivers ample amounts of reprogramming factors to single-cells, creating potential for a powerful gene transfection and reprogramming method. The delivered cargo then transforms the affected cells into a desired cell type without first transforming them to stem cells. TNT is a novel technique and has been used on mice models to successfully transfect fibroblasts into neuron-like cells along with rescue of ischemia in mice models with induced vasculature and perfusion . Current methods require the fabricated TNT chip to be placed on the skin and the loading reservoir filled with a gene solution. An electrode (cathode) is placed into the well with a counter electrode (anode) placed under the chip intradermally (into the skin). The electric field generated delivers the genes . Initial TNT experiments showed that genes could be delivered to the skin of mice. Once this was confirmed, a cocktail of gene factors (ABM) used by Vierbuchen and collaborators to reprogram fibroblast into neurons was used. Delivery of these factors demonstrated successful reprogramming in-vivo  and signals propagated from the epidermis to the dermis skin layers. This phenomenon is believed to be mediated by extracellular vesicles and potentially other factors [18]. Successful reprogramming was determined by performing histology and electrophysiological tests to confirm the tissue behaved as functional neurons. Beyond inducing neurons, Gallego-Perez et al also set out to induce endothelial cells in an ischemic mouse limb that, without proper blood flow, becomes necrotic and decays. Using a patented cocktail of plasmids (Etv2, Fli1, Foxc2, or EFF), these factors were delivered to the tissue above the surgery site. Using various methods, including histology and laser speckle imaging, perfusion and the establishment of new vasculature was verified as early as 7 days post-treatment. The technique was developed to combat the limitations of current approaches, such as a shortage in donors to supply cell sources and the need to induce pluripotency. Reprogramming cells in vivo takes advantage of readily available cells, bypassing the need for pre-processing. Most reprogramming methods have a heavy reliance on viral transfection TNT allows for implementation of a non-viral approach which is able to overcome issues of capsid size, increase safety, and increase deterministic reprogramming.",The electric field generated delivers the genes.,The electric field generated delivers the genes.,,

done,"Western African Ebola virus epidemic [HEAD] Overview [SEP] Ebola virus disease (commonly known as ""Ebola"") was first described in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and what is now South Sudan. The 2013–2016 outbreak, caused by Ebola virus (EBOV), was the first anywhere in the world to reach epidemic proportions. Previous outbreaks had been brought under control in a much shorter period of time. Extreme poverty , dysfunctional healthcare systems , distrust of government after years of armed conflict , and the delay in responding for several months , all contributed to the failure to control the Western African Ebola virus epidemic . Other factors, per media reports, included local burial customs of washing the body and the unprecedented spread of Ebola to densely populated cities. As the outbreak progressed, the media reports, many hospitals, short on both staff and supplies, were overwhelmed and closed down, leading some health experts to state that the inability to treat other medical needs may have been causing ""an additional death toll [that is] likely to exceed that of the outbreak itself"". Hospital workers, who worked closely with the highly contagious body fluids of the victims, were especially vulnerable to contracting the virus; in August 2014, the WHO reported that ten per cent of the dead had been healthcare workers. In September 2014, it was estimated that the affected countries' capacity for treating Ebola patients was insufficient by the equivalent of 2,122 beds; however, by December 2014 there were enough beds to treat and isolate all reported cases, although the uneven distribution of cases was resulting in serious shortfalls in some areas. The WHO has been widely criticised for its delay in taking action to address the epidemic. On 8 August 2014, it declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. By September 2014, Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF), the non-governmental organisation with the largest working presence in the affected countries, had grown increasingly critical of the international response. Speaking on 3 September, the International President of MSF spoke out concerning the lack of assistance from United Nations (UN) member countries: ""Six months into the worst Ebola epidemic in history, the world is losing the battle to contain it."" In a 26 September statement, the WHO stated that ""[t]he Ebola epidemic ravaging parts of Western Africa is the most severe acute public health emergency seen in modern times"" and its Director-General called the outbreak ""the largest, most complex and most severe we've ever seen"". In March 2015, the United Nations Development Group reported that due to a decrease in trade, closing of borders, flight cancellations, and drop in foreign investment and tourism activity fuelled by stigma, the epidemic had resulted in vast economic consequences in both the affected areas in Western Africa and even in other African nations with no cases of Ebola. On 28 January 2015, the WHO reported that for the first time since the week ending 29 June 2014, there had been fewer than 100 new confirmed cases reported in a week in the three most-affected countries. The response to the epidemic then moved to a second phase, as the focus shifted from slowing transmission to ending the epidemic. On 8 April 2015, the WHO reported a total of only 30 confirmed cases, and the weekly update for 29 July reported only seven new cases. Cases continued to gradually dwindle and on 7 October 2015, all three of the most seriously affected countries, per media reports, recorded their first joint week without any new cases. However, as of late 2015, while the large-scale epidemic had ended, according to media reports, sporadic new cases were still being recorded, frustrating hopes that the epidemic could be declared over.","Extreme poverty, dysfunctional healthcare systems, distrust of government after years of armed conflict, and the delay in responding for several months, all contributed to the failure to control the epidemic.","Extreme poverty, dysfunctional healthcare systems, distrust of government after years of armed conflict, and the delay in responding for several months, all contributed to the failure to control the Western African Ebola virus epidemic.",,

Between 1693 and 1696 she was the principal contributor of poetry to Dunton's The Athenian Mercury, but later regretted her affiliation with him, as ""a print-world impresario"" whose adaptions of masculine gallantry to commercial print were ""ridiculed"" by the literati. Many of these poems were reprinted in Poems on Several Occasions, also published by Dunton. During this time, she wrote in imitation of Pindar under the pseudonyms Philomela and the Pindarick Lady, Pindar's approach to writing odes on abstractions was a popular verse form in the late 17th century. Poems on Several Occasions (1696) Written under the pseudonym Philomela, this collection was published by John Dunton when Rowe was twenty-two. Divine Hymns and Poems on Several Occasions (1704) Published in 1704, Rowe was the featured poet in this collection of didactic religious poetry, which also included Richard Blackmore, John Dennis and John Norris. Poems on Several Occasions (1717)
This collection contains pastorals, hymns, an imitation of Anne Killigrew, a ""vehement defence of women's right to poetry,"" in which she defends women, ""over'rul'd by the Tyranny of the Prouder Sex."" This volume included one of her best known poems, ""On the Death of Mr. Thomas Rowe"", an impassioned poem which she wrote in response to the untimely death of her husband. The poem is said to have been an inspiration for Pope's Eloisa to Abelard (1720), and he included it in the second edition. In it she wrote, ""For thee at once I from the world retire,/To feed in 
silent shades a hopeless fire."" She kept her word and retired to her father's house in Frome. Friendship in Death, in Twenty Letters From the Dead to the Living (1728) Undoubtedly her most popular work, Friendship in Death, first published in 1728, went through at least 79 editions by 1825 and another ten by 1840. In the 18th century, editions of this work consistently outnumbered Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and Richardson's Clarissa and the gap grew wider as the century progressed. The work consists of imaginary letters from virtuous friends and loved ones, including a two-year-old child to his grieving mother, who have died, gone to heaven and wish to impart spiritual advice, mainly in the interest of making sure that the souls of friends and loved ones go to heaven. The subject matter of the letters consists mainly of moral dilemmas and contemporary issues; many of the letters are reminiscent of moral essays, while others are closer to the situations depicted in novels. Here Rowe seems to be conducting a campaign against the libertinism found in amatory fiction. In the preface, Rowe states her didactic intent, ""The Drift of these Letters is, to impress the Notion of the Soul's Immortality; without which, all Virtue and Religion, with their Temporal and Eternal good Consequences, must fall to the Ground."" According to the spirits , death is to be welcomed and not feared since the soul experiences bliss in heaven .

un,"Storyboard [HEAD] Origins [SEP] Many large budget silent films were storyboarded, but most of this material has been lost during the reduction of the studio archives during the 1970s and 1980s. Special effects pioneer Georges Méliès is known to have been among the first filmmakers to use storyboards and pre-production art to visualize planned effects. However, storyboarding in the form widely known today was developed at the Walt Disney studio during the early 1930s. In the biography of her father, The Story of Walt Disney (Henry Holt, 1956), Diane Disney Miller explains that the first complete storyboards were created for the 1933 Disney short Three Little Pigs. According to John Canemaker, in Paper Dreams: The Art and Artists of Disney Storyboards (1999, Hyperion Press), the first storyboards at Disney evolved from comic book-like ""story sketches"" created in the 1920s to illustrate concepts for animated cartoon short subjects such as Plane Crazy and Steamboat Willie, and within a few years the idea spread to other studios. According to Christopher Finch in The Art of Walt Disney ( Abrams , 1974 ) , Disney credited animator Webb Smith with creating the idea of drawing scenes on separate sheets of paper and pinning them up on a bulletin board to tell a story in sequence , thus creating the first storyboard . Furthermore, it was Disney who first recognized the necessity for studios to maintain a separate ""story department"" with specialized storyboard artists (that is, a new occupation distinct from animators), as he had realized that audiences would not watch a film unless its story gave them a reason to care about the characters. The second studio to switch from ""story sketches"" to storyboards was Walter Lantz Productions in early 1935; by 1936 Harman-Ising and Leon Schlesinger Productions also followed suit. By 1937 or 1938, all American animation studios were using storyboards. Gone with the Wind (1939) was one of the first live-action films to be completely storyboarded. William Cameron Menzies, the film's production designer, was hired by producer David O. Selznick to design every shot of the film. Storyboarding became popular in live-action film production during the early 1940s and grew into a standard medium for the previsualization of films. Pace Gallery curator Annette Micheloson, writing of the exhibition Drawing into Film: Director's Drawings, considered the 1940s to 1990s to be the period in which ""production design was largely characterized by the adoption of the storyboard"". Storyboards are now an essential part of the creative process.","According to Christopher Finch in The Art of Walt Disney (Abrams, 1974), Disney credited animator Webb Smith with creating the idea of drawing scenes on separate sheets of paper and pinning them up on a bulletin board to tell a story in sequence, thus creating the first storyboard.","According to Christopher Finch in The Art of Walt Disney (Abrams, 1974), Disney credited animator Webb Smith with creating the idea of drawing scenes on separate sheets of paper and pinning them up on a bulletin board to tell a story in sequence, thus creating the first storyboard.",,
un,"Raloxifene [HEAD] Medical uses [SEP] Raloxifene is used for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It is used at a dosage of 60 mg/day for both the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. In the case of either osteoporosis prevention or treatment, supplemental calcium and vitamin D should be added to the diet if daily intake is inadequate. Raloxifene is used to reduce the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. It is used at a dosage of 60 mg/day for this indication. In the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene ( MORE ) clinical trial , raloxifene decreased the risk of all types of breast cancer by 62 % , of invasive breast cancer by 72 % , and of invasive estrogen receptor - positive breast cancer by 84 % . Conversely, it does not reduce the risk of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. There were no obvious differences in effectiveness of raloxifene in the MORE trial for prevention of breast cancer at a dosage of 60 mg/m2/day relative to 120 mg/m2/day. In the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial, 60 mg/day raloxifene was 78% as effective as 20 mg/day tamoxifen in preventing non-invasive breast cancer. Women with undetectable levels of estradiol (<2.7 pg/mL) have a naturally low risk of breast cancer and, in contrast to women with detectable levels of estradiol, do not experience significant benefit from raloxifene in terms of reduction of breast cancer risk.","In the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene (MORE) clinical trial, raloxifene decreased the risk of all types of breast cancer by 62%, of invasive breast cancer by 72%, and of invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by 84%.","In the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene (MORE) clinical trial, raloxifene decreased the risk of all types of breast cancer by 62%, of invasive breast cancer by 72%, and of invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by 84%.",,
done,"Competition regulator [HEAD] [SEP] A competition regulator is the institution that oversees the functioning of the markets. And the Law in which it takes cognizance of situations having any type of impediments and distortions on the markets and correct them is the competition law (also known as anti-trust law). In general it is an government agency, typically a statutory authority, sometimes called an economic regulator, that regulates and enforces competition laws and may sometimes also enforce consumer protection laws. In addition to such agencies, there is often another body responsible for formulating competition policy. Many nations implement competition laws, and there is general agreement on acceptable standards of behaviour. The degree to which countries enforce their competition policy varies substantially. Competition regulators may also regulate certain aspects of mergers and acquisitions and business alliances and regulate or prohibit cartels and monopolies. Other government agencies may have responsibilities in relation to aspects of competition law that affect companies ( e . g . , the registrar of companies ) . Regulators may form supranational or international alliances like the ECN (European Competition Network), the ICN (International Competition Network), and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development).","Other government agencies may have responsibilities in relation to aspects of competition law that affect companies (e.g., the registrar of companies).","Other government agencies may have responsibilities in relation to aspects of competition law that affect companies (e.g., the registrar of companies).",,

un,"Grey column [HEAD] Clinical significance [SEP] Neurons in the anterior column have been shown to be affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The number of large alpha motor neurons and medium gamma motor neurons was greatly reduced and the number of small neurons was either slightly or greatly reduced depending on the type of ALS. Muscular atrophy has also been shown to have an effect on neurons of the anterior column. A large loss of large alpha motor neurons, medium gamma motor neurons, and small neurons was recorded in cases of muscular atrophy. Damage to the lateral column can result in Horner's syndrome. Multiple system atrophy (MSA), has also been linked to the lateral grey column. MSA has been shown to reduce the cell count in the lateral column by over 50%. The posterior column has a prominent role in the pain system, it is the first central relay in the nociceptive pathway. The first order afferent neuron carries sensory information to the second order neuron in the dorsal horn. The axon of the second order neuron , if it is a projection neuron and not an interneuron , then goes to the third order neuron in the thalamus . The thalamus is known as the ""gateway to the cortex"". The third order neuron then goes to the cerebral cortex. The afferent neurons are either A fibers or C fibers. A fibers are myelinated allowing for faster signal conduction. Among these there are A beta fibers which are faster and carry information about non-painful touch and A delta fibers which are slower and thinner than the A beta fibers. The C fibers are not myelinated and therefore slower. C fibers that carry nociceptive signals can be divided into two types: fibers that contain neuropeptides, like substance P, and fibers that do not contain neuropeptides. The two types terminate in very different areas. Non-peptidergic C fibers are linked to the skin, where they innervate the epidermis while peptidergic C fibers innervate other tissues and deeper parts of the skin. There are two main types of nociceptive signals: sensory and affective.","The axon of the second order neuron, if it is a projection neuron and not an interneuron, then goes to the third order neuron in the thalamus.","The axon of the second order neuron, if it is a projection neuron and not an interneuron, then goes to the third order neuron in the thalamus.",,
done,"Hoppstädten [HEAD] Religion [SEP] From the Middle Ages, the parish of Hoppstädten was a branch parish of Sien. Nevertheless, a small church arose in Hoppstädten in the early 16th century, which the worshippers consecrated to Saint Judoc (Jodokus, Jost, Jobst or Josse in German; in this case, the first form was used). Judoc was born in Brittany about 600. He is revered for helping with many illnesses and seeing to rich harvests. He Saint Judoc rejected an offer to become Brittany ' s ruler and , after a pilgrimage to Rome , he lived in a hermitage . A cult grew up around him and spread, in Germany mainly in Lower Bavaria (Landshut) and the Eifel (Walberg near Bonn). In the time of the Reformation, everyone in the village converted to Lutheranism. The mother church then became Hundsbach, then later Kappeln, as of 1800 Hundsbach once again and then in 1921 once more Kappeln. In 1973, Hoppstädten was parochially attached to Grumbach. After the Thirty Years' War, Catholics once again came to settle, although not in great numbers. They remained a minority. Of the roughly 400 inhabitants today, some 300 are Evangelical and some 60 are Catholic. More than 30 inhabitants adhere to other faiths, or profess none at all. The old chapel, Saint Judoc's (Jodokuskapelle) was torn down in the 19th century after having fallen into disrepair. It was replaced in 1886 by a new church. It is a hall church with a wooden ceiling, a quire with ribbed vaulting and a tower with three floors whose roof tapers from an octagon to a high point.

done,"Ian Dury [HEAD] Biography ; The Blockheads [SEP] The Blockheads' sound drew from its members' diverse musical influences, which included jazz, rock and roll, funk, and reggae, and Dury's love of music hall. The band was formed after Dury began writing songs with pianist and guitarist Chaz Jankel (the brother of music video, TV, commercial and film director Annabel Jankel). Jankel took Dury's lyrics, fashioned a number of songs, and they began recording with members of Radio Caroline's Loving Awareness Band – drummer Charley Charles (born Hugh Glenn Mortimer Charles, Guyana 1945), bassist Norman Watt-Roy, keyboard player Mick Gallagher, guitarist John Turnbull and former Kilburns saxophonist Davey Payne. An album was completed, but major record labels passed on the band. Next door to Dury's manager's office was the newly formed Stiff Records, a perfect home for Dury's maverick style. The single ""Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll"", released 26 August 1977, marked Dury's Stiff debut. Although it was banned by the BBC it was named Single of the Week by NME on its release. The single issue was soon followed, at the end of September, by the album New Boots and Panties!! which, although it did not include the single (neither on the track list, album cover or record label, it was nonetheless actually present as track 1 on side 2 of all the original pressings), achieved platinum status. In October 1977 Dury and his band started performing as Ian Dury & the Blockheads, when the band signed on for the Stiff ""Live Stiffs Tour"" alongside Elvis Costello & the Attractions, Nick Lowe, Wreckless Eric, and Larry Wallis. The tour was a success, and Stiff launched a concerted Ian Dury marketing campaign, resulting in the Top Ten hit ""What a Waste"", and the hit single ""Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick"", which reached No. 1 in the UK at the beginning of 1979, selling just short of a million copies. Again, ""Hit Me"" was not included on the original release of the subsequent album Do It Yourself. With their hit singles, the band built up a dedicated following in the UK and other countries and their next single ""Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3"" made number three in the UK. The band's second album Do It Yourself was released in June 1979 in a Barney Bubbles-designed sleeve of which there were over a dozen variations, all based on samples from the Crown wallpaper catalogue. Bubbles also designed the Blockhead logo. Jankel left the band temporarily and relocated to the US after the release of ""What a Waste"" (his organ part on that single was overdubbed later) but he subsequently returned to the UK and began touring sporadically with the Blockheads, eventually returning to the group full-time for the recording of ""Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick""; according to Mickey Gallagher, the band recorded 28 takes of the song but eventually settled on the second take for the single release. Partly due to personality clashes with Dury, Jankel left the group again in 1980, after the recording of the Do It Yourself LP, and he returned to the US to concentrate on his solo career. The Blockheads group worked solidly over the eighteen months between the release of "" Rhythm Stick "" and their next single , "" Reasons to Be Cheerful "" , which returned them to the charts , making the UK Top 10 . Jankel was replaced by former Dr. Feelgood guitarist Wilko Johnson, who also contributed to the next album Laughter (1980) and its two hit singles, although Gallagher recalls that the recording of the Laughter album was difficult and that Dury was drinking heavily in this period.","The group worked solidly over the eighteen months between the release of ""Rhythm Stick"" and their next single, ""Reasons to Be Cheerful"", which returned them to the charts, making the UK Top 10.","The Blockheads group worked solidly over the eighteen months between the release of ""Rhythm Stick"" and their next single, ""Reasons to Be Cheerful"", which returned them to the charts, making the UK Top 10.",,

done,"Battle of Bloody Marsh [HEAD] Background [SEP] James Oglethorpe led the colonization of Georgia for Great Britain and had chosen Savannah as the principal port for the new colony. In the 1730s, Spain and Great Britain were disputing control of the border between Georgia and La Florida, where the Spanish had several settlements and forts. Given a heightened threat of Spanish invasion, Oglethorpe sought to increase his southern defenses. Accompanied by rangers and two Native American guides, Oglethorpe picked St. Simons Island as the site for a new town and fort. In 1734, Oglethorpe convinced the Parliament and the colonial trustees to pay for a military garrison at the fort. The trustees also recruited a large group of colonists to settle St. Simons Island. The ships bearing the settlers and supplies arrived at Tybee Island early in 1736. From there, some went to the mainland while others traveled via periaguas (also known as pirogues) to St. Simons Island to found Frederica. The town and its fort were built on the elbow of the Frederica River to control approaches from both directions. In 1737, Oglethorpe returned to England to acquire more funding and permission to raise a regiment of soldiers; he gained Parliamentary approval for both. He was appointed commander-in-chief of all British forces (limited as they were) in the colonies of South Carolina and Georgia. Oglethorpe subsequently recruited a company of Scots from Inverness, to migrate with their families to settle at Darien (briefly named ""New Inverness"") on the mainland, at the mouth of the Altamaha River. The men formed a military unit known locally as the Highland Independent Company. Official British records list it as Oglethorpe's Regiment of Foot. It was ranked as 42nd Regiment of Foot (old) in 1747 and disbanded 29 May 1749. Two forts had been constructed about five miles apart on St. Simons Island. Between the two ran a road the width of one wagon, named Military Road. This served to supply the garrison at Fort Frederica and settlers in the nearby village from Fort St. Simons. The battles of Bloody Marsh took place after a Spanish invasion of the island . They were part of the larger conflict known as the War of Jenkins' Ear (1739 to 1748). It derived its name from an incident in 1731. A Spanish boarding party had gone aboard a British brig Rebecca, off the Florida coast, and found that its captain Robert Jenkins was smuggling. The Spanish officer cut off one of Jenkins' ears for piracy. Parliament used the nearly forgotten incident to rally public opinion to their side in 1739, but the war was over trade and territorial competition between Britain and Spain.

imp,"Report on the Lands of the Arid Region of the United States [HEAD] Policy critiques and proposals [SEP] In the report, Powell sites empirical evidence of rain patterns that contradict the theory that Rain follows the plow, which was widely propagated by politicians, scientists, railroad corporations, and proponents of Manifest destiny. Powell also argued against many common practices and laws used to settle unclaimed lands in the Public Domain managed by the General Land Office. Powell discouraged the practice of dividing government land into arbitrary rectangular plots for settlement, arguing that this technique ran the risk of concentrating valuable water resources on single plots, leaving adjacent plots unable to be settled, farmed or used for pasturage. He also pointed out the inadequacies of the Homestead Act of 1860 for settling the arid lands. The Act allowed individuals over the age of 21 to stake a claim for parcel of land of 160 acres. Powell argued that while this was fitting for the humid and sub - humid regions of the country , 160 acres of dry , western land would be too little to support grazing due to sparse vegetation and also too little for agriculture without irrigation due to scarce water availability . As one of the central tenets of his strategy for developing the western United States, Powell proposed that settlements consist of cooperative communities, similar to those of the Mormons, Pueblos, and Hispanic New Mexicans. This communal lifestyle would allow groups to pool the capital for the irrigation projects necessary to draw water from large rivers. This idea stemmed from the notion that smaller streams can often be diverted by individuals but irrigation projects from larger rivers require more work and capital than individual citizens can provide He proposed that collectives of 9 or more individuals be able to create their own irrigation or grazing districts with a maximum number of acres per person. The lands would be surveyed and classified primarily by the United States Geological Survey as irrigable lands, timber lands, pasturage lands, mineral lands, and coal lands. These would have different regulations for communal settlement. Individuals and groups would then democratically determine their own allotments and hold other individuals accountable to prevent fraud Political borders would be organized based on watershed boundaries, guaranteeing access to irrigation for a maximum number of individuals instead of allowing scarce water resources to be controlled by single allotments. In order to further ensure a democratic division of water, Powell was insistent in the report that water rights not be separated from land they irrigated on the basis that this would prevent developers from monopolizing water rights and extorting landowners.","Powell argued that while this was fitting for the humid and sub-humid regions of the country, 160 acres of dry, western land would be too little to support grazing due to sparse vegetation and also too little for agriculture without irrigation due to scarce water availability.","Powell argued that while this was fitting for the humid and sub-humid regions of the country, 160 acres of dry, western land would be too little to support grazing due to sparse vegetation and also too little for agriculture without irrigation due to scarce water availability.",,

un,"Jaisang Depa [HEAD] Early career [SEP] Later in 1637 the title Jaisang Depa was awarded to him by Gushri Khan. Apart from mentioning certain projects he was given, references to Jaisang Depa/Trinle Gyatso in the autobiography are for the most part trivial, recording for example on seven occasions, in 1648, 1650, 1654 (twice), 1656 (twice) and 1661, that he helped nurse Lobzang Gyatso when he was ill. In 1638, Jaisang Depa seems to have himself displeased Sonam Rapten who was unhappy with something he had done and sent him away to Olga to collect the autumn harvest. Sonam Rapten wanted to replace him with Depa Norbu but Lobzang Gyatso prevented this and in the end one Lopa Chodze (lo pa chos mdzad) stood in for him. The projects he was assigned were generally of a religious nature. For example, in 1640, Sonam Rapten decided to restore the practice of Jampal Zilnon, involving complex rites, recitations, costumes and ritual sacred dance, which had been a tradition at the time of the Third Dalai Lama but discontinued during the reign of the Fourth. As Sonam Rapten became preoccupied with the looming Tibetan civil war implementation of the project was delegated to Jaisang Depa. In 1655 and for several years he was put in charge of another project to make numerous statues of various lamas and deities with the help of a team of Nepalese artists. In 1659 Nechung Chogyal (gnas chung chos rgyal) through its oracle advised Lobzang Gyatso to have an image of Dorje Drolo (rdo rje gro lod), a manifestation of Guru Rinpoche, made and installed in the Gonkhang (mgon khang) of his room for his own wellbeing and Jaisang Depa was tasked with organising this. Then in 1660 a retreat house was to be built at the gorge of Phagri (phag ri) and Jaisang Depa made it a compulsory service to transport the wood there from Yung Dargye Ling (g.yung dar rgyas gling). He also made the rough design for a fenced courtyard for the retreat house. At the same time, he was charged with raising funds for the preparation of a large quantity of precious medicine for fever being made by Pontshang Changngo (dpon tshang byang ngos) and he supervised the physician Lhagsam (drung 'tsho lhag bsam) in gathering all the necessary medicinal substances. In 1652, Sonam Rapten made him Head of Delegation and Joint Treasurer of Lobzang Gyatso's historic visit to the Manchu Imperial Court in Beijing. In China, he was given gifts by the emperor as a noble, along with other members of the entourage. In 1654 on returning to Lhasa from China he requested Lobzang Gyatso to write a text on making tsha-tshas, small votive images. In 1658 the news that Sonam Rapten was seriously ill, two days before his death, was broken to Lobzang Gyatso through Jaisang Depa. In 1659 when the rebellion of Depa Norbu and his associates became known , Lobzang Gyatso summoned Jaisang Depa and other aides to a council of war which resolved to send an expeditionary force to Shigatse . During the standoff, when the two Mongol chieftains arrived at Shigatse fort and parleyed with the two main rebels, the rebels, taking the Mongols for mediators, alleged that they, the Mongols, had been misled by the doings of Jaisang Depa and other senior officials in Lhasa. The rebels eventually gave up, however, and dispersed without a fight in the spring of 1660.","In 1659 when the rebellion of Depa Norbu and his associates became known, Lobzang Gyatso summoned Jaisang Depa and other aides to a council of war which resolved to send an expeditionary force to Shigatse.","In 1659 when the rebellion of Depa Norbu and his associates became known, Lobzang Gyatso summoned Jaisang Depa and other aides to a council of war which resolved to send an expeditionary force to Shigatse.",,

done,"Holter Dam [HEAD] Recreational aspects and fishery management [SEP] Drought has also affected the dam's operation. No water was permitted to flow over the dam in 1986 due to drought. In 1992, water flowed over the dam's crest on only a single day. In wetter years, water flows over the dam almost continuously. A severe drought struck the state of Montana beginning in 1999. By May 2004, the dam was permitting only 3,500 cubic foot (99 m3) to 3,000 cubic foot (85 m3) per second downriver. These flows were well below the 4,100 cubic foot (120 m3) per second needed to keep the fishery healthy. The low water flows, coupled with whirling disease, led to a 40 percent drop in big fish (those over 17 inches (430 mm) in length) as well as lower overall numbers of fish immediately below the dam. A 2005 proposal by the managers of the Helena National Forest to draw down Holter Lake by 2 feet (0.61 m) in August 2005 in order to repair Coulter Campground near the Gates of the Mountains had fishermen and recreational outfitters angry due to the likely side-effects on the downstream fishery. But a 2006 study by state wildlife biologists found that, although there had been a slight decline in the number of all fish as well as the sizes of all fish since the sport fish population peaked in 1999, those declines were slight compared to what had been predicted. A 2006-2007 survey of burbot and stonecats in the Missouri River immediately below Holter Dam found four times as many burbot as expected. Heavy snowpack and spring rains in 2008, however, forced dam operators to increase the flow to 11,000 cubic foot (310 m3) per second. By June, flows increased to 16,000 cubic foot (450 m3) per second, permitting a ""flush"" of the river. Flows stayed double their typical flow rates even in July 2008. More recently, in 2009 wildlife experts worried that walleye were washing over Holter Dam into the blue-ribbon trout fishery below the dam. Walleyes are predatory fish that eat small trout and yellow perch, and there were calls to alter the overflow procedures at Holter Dam to prevent walleye from escaping into the lower parts of the Missouri River. In 2010, the State of Montana proposed a 10-year fishery management plan for 11 sport and 10 non-sport fish species in Holter Lake. The regulations would have permitted unlimited walleye fishing below Holter Dam as a means of protecting trout from this voracious, nonnative predator species. Final regulations approved in October 2010 permitted fishermen to catch and remove an unlimited number of walleye from Holter Dam to Cascade Bridge, but limited catches to 20 per day (and 40 in possession) from Cascade Bridge to Black Eagle Dam. These limits were reaffirmed by state fisheries regulations in April 2011. The state also of Montana increased the number of walleye caught between Hauser Dam and Holter Dam to 10 daily ( although all fish 20 to 28 inches ( 51 to 71 cm ) in length had to be released ) , and set the yellow perch limit on Holter Reservoir down to 25 per day .

She began to write as a child; 50 poems written between 1804 and 1814 have been preserved. Droste's maternal grandfather, Baron Werner Adolf von Haxthausen, had remarried after the death of Annette's grandmother in 1772 and built himself a new castle, Schloss Bökerhof, in the village of Bökendorf, Paderborn. Here his sons from his second marriage, Werner and August, had formed an intellectual circle. They were in contact with such celebrated cultural figures as the Brothers Grimm, Clemens Brentano, Friedrich Schlegel, Adele and Johanna Schopenhauer. Droste visited Schloss Bökerhof frequently and made the acquaintance of Wilhelm Grimm. She and her sister contributed folk tales from Westphalia to the Grimms' famous collection of fairy stories. However, neither Grimm nor her uncles gave any encouragement to her literary ambitions. The only literary figure to recognize her talent was Anton Matthias Sprickmann (1749–1833), whom she first met in 1812. Sprickmann was the founder of the theatre in Münster and had known important 18th-century poets Matthias Claudius and Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. Droste trusted Sprickmann's judgement and showed him many of her early works, including the unfinished tragedy Berta oder die Alpen (""Berta, or The Alps"", 1813). Other examples of her juvenilia are the tale in verse Walter (1818) and a novel Ledwina (begun in 1819 but never completed). In 1819–1820, Annette spent a year staying with the Haxthausen family at Schloss Bökerhof, interrupted only by a stay at the nearby spa town of Bad Driburg, where she hoped to find a cure for her health problems. Here she became romantically involved with Heinrich Straube (1794–1847), a Lutheran law student with literary interests, who was a friend of her uncle Baron August von Haxthausen. What happened next is unclear, but it appears that Annette's Aunt, Baroness Anna von Haxthausen (who was in fact four years her junior), and other relatives and Schloss Bökerhof disapproved of Annette's decision to have a serious relationship with a commoner. For this reason, the Baroness von Haxthausen masterminded a society intrigue intended to destroy the relationship in a very public manner. While Heinrich Straube was away pursuing his legal studies at the University of Göttingen , August von Arnswaldt , a Lutheran aristocrat with literary ambitions , pretended to pursue Annette von Droste - Hülshoff romantically . At first flattered by von Arnswaldt's attentions, Annette gave some indications she was in love with him, before telling him she was committed to Heinrich Straube. By this time it was too late, as von Arnswaldt had all the evidence he needed. He traveled to Göttingen and gave Straube proof of Annette's behaviour. The two men wrote a joint letter (which has not been preserved), breaking off all contact with her. She never saw either man again. A few years later, August von Arnswaldt married a widowed Baroness Anna von Haxthausen, the ringleader of the intrigue. Straube became a lawyer in Kassel and married in 1824. When he died in 1847, a lock of Annette's hair was found among his possessions. The ensuing scandal was a catastrophe for Annette and severely damaged both her reputation and her marriage prospects. Feeling betrayed by the role that her own relatives had played, Annette refused to visit Schloss Bökerhof for the next 18 years.","While Straube was away pursuing his legal studies at the University of Göttingen, August von Arnswaldt, a Lutheran aristocrat with literary ambitions, pretended to pursue Annette romantically.","While Heinrich Straube was away pursuing his legal studies at the University of Göttingen, August von Arnswaldt, a Lutheran aristocrat with literary ambitions, pretended to pursue Annette von Droste-Hülshoff romantically.",,

He received stark responses from Manager Online and General Apirat Kongsompong, who insisted that some protesters intended to overthrow the monarchy, or had fallen victim to third-party manipulators. In early September, the leader of the Pheu Thai Party, Sompong Amornwiwat, stated a motion from the opposition coalition to amend Article 256 was aligned with the demands of the protesters. Despite threats to their careers, many Thai celebrities have publicly expressed support for the protesters. A group of 147 university faculty members has issued a statement saying the protesters' demand for monarchical reform did not violate the law. The Thai Academic Network for Civil Rights, another group of 358 scholars, has also expressed full support for the protesters. A physician was sacked for signing petition in support of the movement. In August, UNICEF issued a statement invoking the Convention on the Rights of the Child that called for schools and learning institutions to be safe havens and forums for children's freedom of expression. Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and Amnesty International recognized the peaceful nature of the rallies, and condemned police crackdowns. The Human Rights Watch Asia director stated, ""Criminalizing peaceful protests and calls for political reform is a hallmark of authoritarian rule"" and called for governments and the United Nations to condemn the repression of the protests and urge the release of protesters. Some international groups and individuals expressed their support for the movements, for example Hong Kong student protesters, including activist Joshua Wong. Civil society groups in South Korea urged their government to stop exporting water cannons to Thailand. UN human rights experts, including Clément Nyaletsossi Voule, Special Rapporteur on the Right to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and of Association, issued a statement urging the government to guarantee the fundamental rights of free speech and peaceful assembly and to remove the ban on peaceful protests.

The sides of the square were each 10 miles (16 km) long. The specified orientation results in a diamond shape for the District's original boundaries on most maps. The north-south axis of the District's current boundaries extends southward from the District's north corner near East-West Highway (Maryland Route 410), travels between 17th and 18th Streets, N.W., and continues south across the National Mall to the far shore of the Potomac River; the east-west axis is between the present Constitution Avenue and C Street, N.E. and N.W.

imp,"Alvin Ratz Kaufman [HEAD] Birth control and eugenics [SEP] Kaufman is recognized for playing a key role the birth-control movement in Canada. He became interested in birth control in 1929 at the beginning of the Great Depression. Although company operations had previously relied on seasonal labour, increased layoffs during the Depression brought complaints that those in the most need were being impacted. Visits to family homes by a company nurse supported that those with the most children and the poorest living conditions were struggling compared to those who remained employed. Anne Weber, the nurse tasked with visiting the homes, found growing families and evidence of feeble-mindedness. Ruling out the financial feasibility of keeping seasonal employees on year-round, Kaufman determined the best long-term assistance was to provide family planning services. Initially extended to current and former employees, the family planning services funded by Kaufman were extended to anyone in the Kitchener area. Requests were later received from elsewhere in the province and across Canada. He founded the Parents' Information Bureau (PIB) to help meet increasing demand. The organization employed approximately 50 people in locations across the country who worked to distribute birth control and family planning information in women's homes rather than at clinics. Families visited by PIB representatives were able to make orders for supplies that were in turn mailed directly to their homes. Mailed kits included spermicides , condoms and information about purchasing additional items like diaphragms . As a member of the Eugenics Society of Canada, founded in 1930, Kaufman counted sterilization as a viable means of birth control. He thought that the poverty experienced by poorer classes of people could be remedied by alleviating the financial burden of having an excessive number of children. He further believed that the socially and mentally deficient were unable to reliably use alternative methods of birth control such as properly inserting a diaphragm, making sterilization the best way to prevent them from reproducing. In 1935, while pushing for a government department dedicated to birth control, Kaufman recommended sterilization for ""patients in the dull normal class or worse"" while addressing the American birth control league. Kaufman continued to support and advocate eugenics well after the widespread abandonment of eugenic social policies following World War II. The PIB continued to operate until 1978 with Kaufman reportedly telling an associate: ""We're now respectable – as you can see on any drugstore counter."" Between 1930 and 1969, approximately 1,000 sterilization procedures were performed on Kaufman factory employees. In a review of the Canadian birth control movement, historian Dianne Dodd framed Kaufman's interest in birth control as financially and politically motivated, rather than one rooted in providing women reproductive control, as it provided an easy way to address the social unrest tied to poverty and unemployment while avoiding social or economic reform.","Mailed kits included spermicides, condoms and information about purchasing additional items like diaphragms.","Mailed kits included spermicides, condoms and information about purchasing additional items like diaphragms.",,

Between 29 January and 3 February she screened the carriers of Task Group 58.2 off Kwajalein, then retired to Majuro. From Majuro her group raided Truk 16 February and then retired briefly to Pearl Harbor, returning to Majuro in mid-March. On 22 March, the carriers, supported by battleships and cruisers and screened by a ring of destroyers, departed the atoll with Owen in the outer ring of steel. Completing strikes at Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai, 29 March – 1 April, they returned to Majuro, whence they headed for New Guinea. There they supported Army assault forces with raids on Hollandia, Wakde, Sewar and Sarmi, 21 April – 22 April and then struck at Truk, Satawan and Ponape 29 April – 1 May. Next the The USS Owen ( DD - 536 ) force hit Marcus and Wake Islands , 19 May – 23 May and then prepared for the Marianas campaign . On 6 June, the carrier force again sortied from Majuro. From 11 May through 17 May, its ships and planes ranged from the Volcanoes and Bonins to the southernmost Marianas in support of the assault on Saipan. On the 17th, after screening the carriers during strikes against Saipan, Tinian, Rota and Guam, Owen received word of a Japanese fleet en route from the Philippines. On 18 May, screening continued as she waited. On 19 May, enemy dive bombers opened the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Throughout the two day battle, which permanently crippled the Japanese sea-borne aerial arm, she carried out her protective mission in the screen of Bunker Hill. Strikes on Pagan Island preceded a brief upkeep at Eniwetok. In July, the force struck Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima, Palau, Ulithi, and Yap. During August there were further operations in the Marianas and against the Bonins. September raids against Palau, Mindanao, Leyte, Luzon and Samar in support of the Palau campaign were followed in October by a foray into the East and South China Seas. On 20 October, the force supported amphibious operations on Leyte and Samar. Owen, forced by boiler trouble to miss the China Seas operations, rejoined the force for the Leyte landings. On 25 October, Owen, temporarily with TG 34.5, sailed to assist TF 77 units which had engaged enemy forces attempting to enter Leyte Gulf. Shortly after midnight, off the eastern end of San Bernardino Strait, an enemy destroyer, Nowaki, was taken under fire. After several exchanges, Owen and Miller closed to deliver the final blows. They accomplished their mission in under 20 minutes. Nowaki was sunk with the loss of all hands and also those survivors of the Japanese cruiser Chikuma who were picked up a day before. Raids against enemy installations in the Philippines continued into November. On 25 November the force retired to Ulithi, whence it sortied, 11 December, to support amphibious operations on Mindoro. Strikes on Formosa preceded another return to the Philippines in support of amphibious landings, this time in Lingayen Gulf.","Next the force hit Marcus and Wake Islands, 19 May – 23 May and then prepared for the Marianas campaign.","The USS Owen (DD-536) force hit Marcus and Wake Islands, 19 May – 23 May and then prepared for the Marianas campaign.",,

done,"Robby the Robot [HEAD] Forbidden Planet ; Design and construction [SEP] The Robby suit was constructed using a range of materials including metal, plastic, rubber, glass, and Plexiglas. The plastic parts were a pioneering example of the use of the then novel technology of vacuum-forming heated plastic over wooden molds. These parts were made from an early form of ABS plastic with the brand name ""Royalite"", a material mainly used at the time for making suitcases. The finished Robby stands just over 7-foot (2.1 m) tall and was fabricated in three detachable sections: the legs and lower torso, the barrel-like chest section (which included the arms), and the highly detailed head piece. The tall paraboloidal plexiglass dome that covered the head housed the detailed mechanisms representing Robby's electronic brain. These included a ""pilot light"" at the very top, an intricate apparatus terminating in three white wire-frame spheres that rotate in planetary fashion (representing his gyroscopic stabilizers), a pair of reciprocating arms in the shape of an inverted ""V"", multiple flashing lights, and an elaborate horizontal array of moving levers resembling saxophone keys. Conical protuberances attached to each side of the head carry two small forward-facing blinking lights (his eyes) and two rotating chromed rings, one mounted vertically and the other horizontally, which represent Robby's audio detectors (his ears). The bottom front section of the head is a curved grille consisting of parallel rows of thin blue neon tubes, which light up in synchronization with Robby's voice. This neon grille also enabled the operator to both see out and to breathe. The joint between the head and chest section was fitted with a custom-made bearing that allowed the head to rotate 45 degrees in either direction. Robby's bulky barrel-shaped torso (a sly reference to Bob Kinoshita's earlier job as a washing machine designer) featured a front panel fitted with a rectangular flap at the top (into which samples of any substance could be inserted for Robby to analyze and replicate); underneath the slot were two rotating discs fitted with small flashing lights and below that a row of five buttons that moved in and out. Robby's thick, stubby arms were connected to his body with plastic ball-joints that fitted into matching sockets in the torso, allowing the joints a small amount of rotational movement. The arms could also be extended and this section was covered with a concertina-type tubular rubber sheath. Robby's three-fingered hands were also made of rubber, finished with the suit's overall gunmetal metallic gray paint. The chest section attached to the leg section with special locking clips. The bottom section of the Robby the Robot suit hinged at the top of the legs , allowing Robby to both bend forward and swing each leg backward and forward slightly , enabling him to walk with relative ease ( albeit with rather small and stiff steps ) . Robby's legs were made from interlocking globes of vacuum-formed plastic, which were connected by internal jointing that permitted the entire leg to bend slightly, but cleverly concealed the movement of the hips and knees of the human operator inside.","The bottom section of the suit hinged at the top of the legs, allowing Robby to both bend forward and swing each leg backward and forward slightly, enabling him to walk with relative ease (albeit with rather small and stiff steps).","The bottom section of the Robby the Robot suit hinged at the top of the legs, allowing Robby to both bend forward and swing each leg backward and forward slightly, enabling him to walk with relative ease (albeit with rather small and stiff steps).",,

The aircraft was carrying 167 passengers and 11 crew members on its first leg, and 50 of these passengers disembarked in Paris. The flight's second leg, from Paris to London Heathrow Airport, was normally underbooked; however, due to a strike by British European Airways employees, many London-bound travelers, who had been stranded at Orly, were booked onto Flight 981, delaying the flight departure by 30 minutes. The aircraft left Orly Airport at 12:32, bound for Heathrow Airport, and took off in an easterly direction, before turning north. Shortly after takeoff, Flight 981 was cleared to flight level 230 (23,000 ft or 7,000 m) and started turning west towards London. Just after the aircraft passed over the town of Meaux, the rear left cargo door blew off and the sudden difference in air pressure between the cargo area and the pressurized passenger cabin above it, which amounted to 36 kPa (5.2 psi), caused a section of the cabin floor above the open hatch to separate and be forcibly ejected through the open hatch, along with six occupied passenger seats attached to that floor section. The fully recognizable bodies of the six Japanese passengers who were ejected from the aircraft were found along with the plane's rear cargo hatch, having landed in a turnip field near Saint-Pathus, approximately 15 kilometres (8 nautical miles) south of where the remainder of the plane was found. An air traffic controller noted that, as the flight was cleared to FL230, he had briefly seen a second echo on his radar that remained stationary behind the aircraft; this was likely the remains of the rear cargo door. When the door blew off, the primary as well as both sets of backup control cables that ran beneath the section of floor that blew out were completely severed, destroying the pilots' ability to control the plane's elevators, rudder, and number two engine. The flight data recorder showed that the throttle for engine two snapped shut when the door failed. The loss of control of these key components resulted in the pilots losing control of the aircraft entirely. The aircraft almost immediately attained a 20-degree pitch down and began picking up speed, while Captain Berköz and First Officer Ulusman struggled to regain control. At some point, one of the crew members pressed their microphone button broadcasting the pandemonium in the cockpit on the departure frequency. Controllers also picked up a distorted transmission from the plane and the aircraft's pressurization and overspeed warnings were heard over the pilots' words in Turkish, including the co-pilot saying, ""the fuselage has burst!"" As the plane's speed increased, the additional lift raised the nose again. Berköz is recorded calling out, ""Speed!"" and pushed the throttles forward in order to level off. Seventy - seven seconds after the cargo door gave way on Turkish Airlines Flight 981 , the plane crashed into the trees of Ermenonville Forest , a state - owned forest at Bosquet de Dammartin in the commune of Fontaine - Chaalis , Oise . At the point of impact, the aircraft was traveling at a speed of approximately 430 kn (800 km/h) at a slight left turn, fast enough to disintegrate the plane into thousands of pieces. The wreckage was so fragmented that it was difficult to determine whether any parts of the aircraft were missing before it crashed. Post-crash fires were small because there were few large pieces of the aircraft left intact to burn. Of the 346 passengers and crew on board, only 40 bodies were visually identifiable, with rescue teams recovering some 20,000 body fragments in all. Nine passengers were never identified.","Seventy-seven seconds after the cargo door gave way, the plane crashed into the trees of Ermenonville Forest, a state-owned forest at Bosquet de Dammartin in the commune of Fontaine-Chaalis, Oise.","Seventy-seven seconds after the cargo door gave way on Turkish Airlines Flight 981, the plane crashed into the trees of Ermenonville Forest, a state-owned forest at Bosquet de Dammartin in the commune of Fontaine-Chaalis, Oise.",,

The project was delayed by court cases, politicians and environmental organisations such as the commune of Turenne and Query Perigord and candidates for d’Europe Écologie in the European Parliamentary elections. Most regarded it as a large international project that could not be managed on a local scale, while other concerns included the effect on public finances, opposition from Limoges Airport, noise pollution and a colony of the large blue butterfly. Earthworks began in October 2005 and continued until spring 2007 as the site 200ha limestone site needed to be levelled and filled. 2.8 million m3 of earth was moved during these earthworks. The runway, 2.1km long and 45m wide, was laid down in 2008 as were taxiways and aprons while the building work for the airport control tower and buildings were underway in 2009.

imp,"Esk–Hampton Road [HEAD] History [SEP] From a historical perspective the Esk–Hampton Road consists of three sections of approximately equal length. The eastern section, from Esk to the foothills of the Great Dividing Range, was developed along Redbank Creek (the watercourse) to provide access to stands of timber, and to a sawmill that was located at Redbank Creek (the locality). Subsequently, it serviced farms that were established on land cleared of most old-growth forest. The western section, from Hampton to the end of a spur of the Great Dividing Range, was also developed to facilitate the harvesting of timber. Prior to European settlement the rich volcanic soil on the ridge supported a sub-tropical rainforest, which contained timbers that were in high demand, including red cedar, tallowwood and hoop pine. These timbers were used in some homes constructed in the area at the time . The road later provided access to cleared land that was used for dairying and beef cattle grazing. This section provides access to Ravensbourne National Park, which preserves a remnant of the rainforest. The central (mountain) section was developed later, to enable more direct travel between the two districts. The road is now a popular tourist drive, particularly as part of a round trip from the Brisbane area to the Toowoomba district. It is rated as a ""good ride"" by motorcycling tourists. The mountain section was completed in 1929. One of the most difficult sections to complete was the Pryde's Pinch section which had a steep gradient and was not suitable for traffic until sometime after 1932.",These timbers were used in some homes constructed in the area at the time.,These timbers were used in some homes constructed in the area at the time.,,
un,"Hólar University College [HEAD] History ; Bishop's seat and the bishops [SEP] During Catholic times, Hólar accumulated great wealth and was densely populated. During the peak of the bishop's seat era, Hólar owned 352 estates that accounted for about a quarter of all the estates in the north of the country. Apart from that it enjoyed the privilege of driftwood (a valuable resource) along with rights to other advantages in several surrounding areas. The first printing press in Iceland was installed here around 1530 and Hólar was the last stronghold of the Catholic Church during the Reformation. The present cathedral, consecrated in 1763, is the oldest stone church in Iceland. Hólar remained a bishop's seat for almost seven centuries from 1106 until 1802 when Hólar was sold. During that era Hólar was the true centre of northern Iceland and one of the major cultural centres of the area. This status was partly due to the school that was around there for most of this time. Of the thirty six bishops who resided at Hólar, twenty three were Catholic and thirteen Lutheran. Many of these have left their mark in Icelandic history. Among the most well known are Jón Ögmundsson, the Sacred (1106-1121), Guðmundur Arason the Good (1203-1237), Jón Arason (1524-1550) and Guðbrandur Þorláksson (1571-1627). The first bishop in Hólar was Jón Ögmundsson the Sacred, who was ordained in 1106. He established and ran a seminary at Hólar and became very well known for this as well as his management of the church. The commonly used phrase ""heim að Hólum"" or ""back home to Hólar"" dates back to him. Guðmundur Arason the Good was famous for his rivalry with some of the most respected chieftains in northern Iceland . Guðmundur went on to lead a band of followers in what became a semi vagrant life. Jón Arason was the last Catholic bishop, he fought strongly against the Reformation and was finally beheaded along with his two sons in Skálholt in November 1550, and the resistance against the Reformation came to an end. Jón was a well known poet and it was he who brought the first printing press to Iceland in around 1530. Guðbrandur Þorláksson was famous for his active book publishing, among of them was the first translation of the Bible into Icelandic, which was printed in 1584. The printing of this Bible is thought to have played a crucial role in the preservation of the Icelandic language. Hólar became a vicarage after the bishop's seat was abolished until 1861 when the vicarage was moved to Viðvík. In 1952 Hólar was re- established as a vicarage and in 1986 it became the residence of the ordained bishop of the Hólar benefice. The present bishop at Hólar is Solveig Lára Guðmundsdóttir.",Guðmundur Arason the Good was famous for his rivalry with some of the most respected chieftains in northern Iceland.,Guðmundur Arason the Good was famous for his rivalry with some of the most respected chieftains in northern Iceland.,,

done,"Pyrrhus The First [HEAD] Racing career ; 1846: three-year-old season [SEP] Early in 1846, Pyrrhus The First was offered for sale to a Mr Clifton for £500, but Clifton instead purchased his stable companion, Old England. The colt was unraced as a two-year-old and had leg problems that made him difficult to train, leading one report in the Illustrated London News to claim that he took ""more walking exercise than any Derby winner on record"". He was not seriously tested until April when he impressed Day in a trial gallop. He was then sent to the Newmarket Spring Meeting, where he won the Newmarket Stakes, beating Iago by half a length. Pyrrhus The First then produced another impressive training gallop to establish himself as a leading contender for the Derby. At Epsom on 27 May, Pyrrhus The First started second favourite for the Derby at odds of 8/1 in a field of twenty-seven runners. Fancy Boy was made 5/1 favourite, while the 2000 Guineas winner, Sir Tatton Sykes started at 10/1. Ridden by his trainer's uncle, the forty-four-year-old Sam Day, Pyrrhus The First was not among the early front-runners, but had moved up to join the leading group on the turn into the straight. Sir Tatton Sykes, who had made up a great deal of ground after being left behind at the start, was sent into the lead by his jockey Bill Scott a furlong from the finish, but Day produced his colt with a strong run in the stretch to overtake the Guineas winner in the last strides and win by a neck, with Brocardo third. Later reports claim that Scott had missed the start because he was drunk and was in no condition to ride a finish, making Sir Tatton Sykes an unlucky loser. The race was the first Derby to be officially timed, with Pyrrhus The First covering the one and a half mile distance in 2:55.0. The result of the race, together with the Classical origins of the winner's name, inspired a poem published in Bentley's Miscellany, ending with the stanza: Pyrrhus The First was withdrawn from the Welcome Stakes at Ascot and did not appear in another competitive race as a three-year-old. He Pyrrhus The First walked over in the Foal Stakes at Winchester Racecourse when no other horses opposed him and in October , his owners paid a forfeit of £100 when he failed to appear for a scheduled match race at level weights against a Grimston , a four - year - old colt who had won the Gold Vase .

un,"Radiation damage [HEAD] Effects on materials and devices ; Effects on solids ; Thermo-mechanical effects of irradiation [SEP] Radiation hardening is the strengthening of the material in question by the introduction of defect clusters, impurity-defect cluster complexes, dislocation loops, dislocation lines, voids, bubbles and precipitates. For pressure vessels , the loss in ductility that occurs as a result of the increase in hardness is a particular concern . Radiation embrittlement results in a reduction of the energy to fracture, due to a reduction in strain hardening (as hardening is already occurring during irradiation). This is motivated for very similar reasons to those that cause radiation hardening; development of defect clusters, dislocations, voids, and precipitates. Variations in these parameters make the exact amount of embrittlement difficult to predict, but the generalized values for the measurement show predictable consistency. Thermal creep in irradiated materials is negligible, by comparison to the irradiation creep, which can exceed 10−6sec−1. The mechanism is not enhanced diffusivities, as would be intuitive from the elevated temperature, but rather interaction between the stress and the developing microstructure. Stress induces the nucleation of loops, and causes preferential absorption of interstitials at dislocations, which results in swelling. Swelling, in combination with the embrittlement and hardening, can have disastrous effects on any nuclear material under substantial pressure. Growth in irradiated materials is caused by Diffusion Anisotropy Difference (DAD). This phenomenon frequently occurs in zirconium, graphite, and magnesium because of natural properties. Thermal and electrical conductivity rely on the transport of energy through the electrons and the lattice of a material. Defects in the lattice and substitution of atoms via transmutation disturb these pathways, leading to a reduction in both types of conduction by radiation damage. The magnitude of reduction depends on the dominant type of conductivity (electronic or Wiedemann–Franz law, phononic) in the material and the details of the radiation damage and is therefore still hard to predict.","For pressure vessels, the loss in ductility that occurs as a result of the increase in hardness is a particular concern.","For pressure vessels, the loss in ductility that occurs as a result of the increase in hardness is a particular concern.",,

un,"Expanding monomer [HEAD] Background ; Conventional methods for shrinkage reduction [SEP] Considerable research has been done to reduce shrinkage during polymerization. As methods the addition of fillers, the use of prepolymers, the addition of reactive diluents and special crosslinking agents are conventionally used. It is a general rule that the lower the reactive portion, the lower the shrinkage of the resin is during polymerization. Fillers (silica, mica, quartz, etc.) are reducing the shrinkage in proportion to the used amount since the volume stable filler replaces the shrinking polymer. The viscosity increase which is caused by fillers is disadvantageous since it restricts the flow of resins and mold fill . Furthermore, problematic is their tendency of settling. Prepolymers did undergo polymerization already to some extent. However, they are still viscous and not yet gelatinised. As prepolymers are already partially polymerized the shrinking is therefore reduced during the final cure. The higher the molecular weight of the used monomers the lower the shrinkage in volume. Also the addition of reactive diluents can reduce the shrinkage in proportion to the extent of its addition.",The viscosity increase which is caused by fillers is disadvantageous since it restricts the flow of resins and mold fill.,The viscosity increase which is caused by fillers is disadvantageous since it restricts the flow of resins and mold fill.,,

August–September 1919 [SEP] The events of the first decade of August 1919 were determined by Denikin's stubborn desire to fulfill the first part of the Moscow directive (taking Balashov and Saratov). But all attempts of the Don and the Caucasian armies to advance eastwards of the Don were thwarted. In the west, the Volunteer Army pursued the enemy defeated in July without much resistance, and reached the Hadiach - Kremenchuk - Znamianka - Yelisavetgrad line on 11 August. It was discovered that the combat capability of the western part of the Southern Front of the Red Army was unexpectedly low. This led to the correction of Denikin's combat plan: without formally canceling the previous tasks of the Moscow Directive in the east, Denikin proclaimed on August 12 a new Directive, ordering the Volunteer Army and the 3rd Separate Corps to immediately launch a general offensive towards the west, regardless of the situation on other sectors of the front. A special Kiev Group under General Bredov was created to attack Kiev. A. Nemirovsky writes that the main goal of Denikin in this period was still to provide a wide, straightened front for subsequent actions on Moscow, only this time with an extension to the west. The construction of such a front was further facilitated by the good prospect of connecting with the Poles and creating a common anti - Bolshevik front with them .

He worked as a professional translator and later as a court translator. In 1916, he ran for political office, but his criminal past was exposed, which he had kept hidden. To gain additional strength from the local Italian power base, he ran and was elected president of the Chicago chapter of the Unione in or around 1919. In 1921, he ran against John Powers, who ended up with more Italian support than D'Andrea. There were numerous bombings and killings from followers of both men, and D'Andrea dropped out of the race. Nevertheless , he Antonio D ' Andrea was shot and mortally wounded in May , 1921 . Michele Merlo was a leader in D'Andrea's Mafia organization who went by the name of Mike Merlo. He had been vacationing in Italy, but he made an emergency return upon hearing of D'Andrea's death. According to Nicola Gentile, he ordered the death of D'Andrea's assassin. For this act, he took control of the Chicago Mafia, and replaced D'Andrea as president of the Unione, as well. His brief term was regarded as a successful one, and he was noted to have kept the criminal organizations of John Torrio and Dean O'Banion from warring with each other. Merlo died of cancer in 1924, and the chapter organization split into several factions (later renamed the ""Italo-American National Union""), as various underworld groups struggled for control of the organization. Of these factions, ""Bloody"" Angelo Genna claimed the presidency following Merlo's death; however, he was murdered the following year by members of the North Side Gang. Genna's successor Samuzzo ""Samoots"" Amatuna was killed in a barbershop that same year, allegedly by Northsider Vincent ""The Schemer"" Drucci. Myth has it that Al Capone had amassed enough power in Chicago to place Antonio Lombardo as head of the Unione Siciliane"", but Lombardo was believed to have been chosen by outside Mafia leaders for his abilities as a peacemaker. Lombardo was from eastern Sicily, but he agreed with Supreme President Bernard Barasa to change the name to the Italo-American National Union to increase awareness that the association was not only for Sicilians. Lombardo held considerable influence in Italian-American communities, including acting as a negotiator between [Black Hand] kidnappers and victim's families. It is traditionally believed that he was supported by Capone, but many members of the organization opposed his reforms. A faction challenged Lombardo, under the leadership of Capone rival Joe [Aiello], calling for his withdrawal from office. Lombardo's refusal resulted in his death on September 7, 1928. According to Nick Gentile, however, Aiello was Lombardo's underboss and Capone was given permission by Joseph Masseria (a boss of one of New York's Five Families and soon a ""Boss of Bosses"") to eliminate both Aiello and Lombardo. Gentile believed that Capone was responsible for Lombardo's death. Pasqualino ""Patsy"" Lolordo assumed the presidency for around four months until his own murder by Joe Aiello at his home on January 8, 1929. Aiello claimed the presidency the next day and reportedly held the office for a year and a half until his death by a Chicago Outfit gunman on October 23, 1930. In fact, he may never have held office.","Nevertheless, he was shot and mortally wounded in May, 1921.","Antonio D'Andrea was shot and mortally wounded in May, 1921.",,

Richards won the National Boys Outdoor Singles Tournament in 1917. He became a protégé of Bill Tilden after being defeated by the latter in a match, and he then teamed up with him to win the United States doubles championship in 1918 at the age of 15. He remains the youngest male to have ever won a major championship. Twenty-seven years later, in 1945, he and Tilden won the United States Pro doubles title. While Bill Tilden teamed with Richards to win titles together, he was beaten by Richards in both singles and doubles, including for several major titles. During their long rivalry, they faced each other 102 times, with Richards holding a career record of 52–50 against Tilden. Richards retained his amateur status for 10 ""bestemor"" years because his ambition was to compete in the 1924 Olympics held in Paris, France. He realized this ambition by winning the gold medal for the United States in both singles and doubles, additionally collecting the silver medal in mixed doubles. Richards is one of two American male tennis players to win the gold medal in both singles and doubles (Beals Wright was the other), and he ranks second all-time with his three medals won in 1924 (second to Reginald Doherty of Great Britain, who won four Olympic tennis medals). Between both men and women, Richards is tied with Venus Williams with three overall medals, with Williams collecting three gold medals over multiple Olympics. Richards was a semifinalist at the French championships in 1926, where he beat Colin Gregory and Bela Von Kehrling, then lost to Henri Cochet. He was also a semifinalist at the U.S. championships in 1922 (losing to Bill Johnston), 1924 (losing to Tilden), 1925 (where he beat René Lacoste, then lost to Tilden) and 1926 (losing to Jean Borotra). While there was no official ATP Tour in the 1920s, Richards was one of the pioneers in creating a version of a ""world tennis tour"", playing in the equivalent of all four grand slams during his career, additional major tournaments, and exhibition matches in front of emperors, presidents, and other heads of states. While Tilden may have overshadowed Richards, even in the Davis Cup, Richards held a perfect 5–0 record when he played for his country. Richards was one of the best singles players of the 1920s and played on several United States Davis Cup teams. In 1927 he was the first prominent male player to turn professional. In 1928, he was still generally considered to be one of the top 5 or 6 players in the world and played a brief tour at the end of the year against Czech player Karel Koželuh, another new professional. Richards only beat Koželuh five times in 20 matches. Richards won the United States Pro Championship in 1927, 1928, and 1930, beating Koželuh in the finals in both 1928 and 1930, and losing to him in the 1929 final. He lost the 1931 final to Tilden and won the U.S. Pro Championships for the last time in 1933, this time beating Frank Hunter in the final.

In 1590 the Portuguese sent Cristóvão de Barros to both subjugate the region to colonial rule and establish a safe trading port between Salvador and Pernambuco. De Barros quickly and violently defeated the local population, which consisted of people of mixed Tupinambá and French heritage who maintained a trade in Brazilwood. As a symbol of his victory De Barros founded a small village named for his patron saint, Saint Christopher. The development of the town followed the Portuguese urban model, that is, in two plans: the higher town, where the headquarters of the civil and religious powers are; and lower town, with the harbour, the factories, and the low income population. The economy of São Cristóvão initially depended on the establishment of cattle herds for meat, milk, and leather. The settlement was completely destroyed by the Dutch in 1637. Tobacco and sugarcane plantations were established in the 17th century, and remained into the modern period. São Cristóvão was the state capital until 1855 , when the provincial president Inácio Joaquim Barbosa moved the capital to Aracaju . In 1967, the city was designated a national monument to preserve its colonial architecture, and it is now home to ten national heritage sites of Brazil. Among the important sacred buildings are the Church and Convent of Santa Cruz (also known as the Church and Convent of São Francisco, which date from 1693), the Misericórdia Hospital and Church (Santa Casa de Misericordia, the 17th-century Sisters of Mercy hospital), the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception of Mary (1751), the Parish Church of Our Lady of Victory (1608) and several other important churches from the 18th century, including the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary of Black Men, the Church of Our Lady of Protection, and the Monastery of São Bento. Ten national or state heritage sites are located in or near the city center; two, the Chapel of Our Lady of the Conception of Engenho Poxim and the Church of Our Lady of Nazareth of Engenho Itaperoá, are abandoned and on sugarcane plantations far from the city center. The religious sites of São Cristóvão remain an important center of Roman Catholic pilgrimage in Brazil.

un,"Adonidia merrillii [HEAD] Uses, Cultivation, and Care [SEP] The Adonidia palm , sometimes described as the "" mini - royal - palm "" , adapts well to landscaping and cultivation , as well as growing in pots . It is able to withstand large amounts of rainfall and can tolerate short droughts, though it does not like sea salt. Adonidias prefer full sun but can withstand partial shade. They are not tolerant of the cold (hardy to 35F when young; 30F when mature), making their perennial outdoor usage limited to frost-free zones. One of the most common landscape palms in Southern Florida (used at such places as Mar-A-Lago and the Miami Open tennis tournament), it is often clustered together in groups of 2-3, sometimes four. Because, in its natural state, it grows as a solitary palm, this batching together of several heads runs the risk of the head competing against themselves. In order to minimize the risk, nurseries train these palms when young to arch outward, instead of growing straight up. Adonidia merrillii is widely planted in cultivation and grows well in tropical locations such as Hawaii and the southern half of the Florida peninsula. It is also one of the most commonly planted ornamental palms in the world, often planted in non-tropical locations such as shopping malls. It is sometimes used as an annual in places that freeze in the Winter (for example, Times Square, New York City plants these for the warm-weather season). The Adonidia is also commonly placed indoors in hotels, casinos, and other higher-end establishments due to its ability to adjust to lower light conditions. They are self-pruning palms and require little to no maintenance. Its fruits are sometimes said to be used as a substitute for the betel nut, in preparing buyo (fruit of Areca catechu, leaves of Piper betle, and lime) for chewing.","The Adonidia palm, sometimes described as the ""mini-royal-palm"", adapts well to landscaping and cultivation, as well as growing in pots.","The Adonidia palm, sometimes described as the ""mini-royal-palm"", adapts well to landscaping and cultivation, as well as growing in pots.",,

un,"Consistency model [HEAD] Consistency and replication ; Consistency protocols ; Replicated-write protocols [SEP] In replicated-write protocols, unlike the primary-based protocol, all updates are carried out to all replicas. In active replication, there is a process associated to each replica to perform the write operation. In other words, updates are sent to each replica in the form of an operation in order to be executed. All updates need to be performed in the same order in all replicas. As a result, a totally-ordered multicast mechanism is required. There is a scalability issue in implementing such a multicasting mechanism in large distributed systems. There is another approach in which each operation is sent to a central coordinator (sequencer). The coordinator first assigns a sequence number to each operation and then forwards the operation to all replicas. Second approach cannot also solve the scalability problem. Voting can be another approach in replicated-write protocols. In this approach, a client requests and receives permission from multiple servers in order to read and write a replicated data. As an example , suppose in a distributed file system , a file is replicated on N servers . To update a file, a client must send a request to at least N/2 + 1 in order to make their agreement to perform an update. After the agreement, changes are applied on the file and a new version number is assigned to the updated file. Similarly, for reading replicated file, a client sends a request to N/2 + 1 servers in order to receive the associated version number from those servers. Read operation is completed if all received version numbers are the most recent version. In a replicated file system, a cache-coherence protocol provides the cache consistency while caches are generally controlled by clients. In many approaches, cache consistency is provided by the underlying hardware. Some other approaches in middleware-based distributed systems apply software-based solutions to provide the cache consistency. Cache consistency models can differ in their coherence detection strategies that define when inconsistencies occur. There are two approaches to detect the inconsistency; static and dynamic solutions. In the static solution, a compiler determines which variables can cause the cache inconsistency. So, the compiler enforces an instruction in order to avoid the inconsistency problem. In the dynamic solution, the server checks for inconsistencies at run time to control the consistency of the cached data that has changed after it was cached. The coherence enforcement strategy is another cache-coherence protocol. It defines that how to provide the consistency in caches by using the copies located on the server. One way to keep the data consistent is to never cache the shared data. A server can keep the data and apply some consistency protocol such as primary-based protocols to ensure the consistency of shared data. In this solution, only private data can be cached by clients. In the case that shared data are cached, there are two approaches in order to enforce the cache coherence. In first approach, when a shared data is updated, the server forwards invalidation to all caches. In second approach, an update is propagated. Most caching systems apply these two approaches or dynamically choose between them.","As an example, suppose in a distributed file system, a file is replicated on N servers.","As an example, suppose in a distributed file system, a file is replicated on N servers.",,

un,"Springvale, Victoria [HEAD] History [SEP] The area that is now Springvale has been inhabited by the Woiwurrung and Boonwurrung people for tens of thousands of years. The municipal area of Springvale is at the doorstep of the Dandenong Ranges National Park. The area contained natural springs which were a permanent water source for stock and travellers moving between Melbourne and Dandenong, giving rise to the suburb's name. In the 1840s, Springvale was the residence of Christian Ludolph Johannes De Villiers; a South-African leader of the Native Police. De Villiers founded an inn 'No-Good-Damper' in the area which was infamous for bushranger attacks. No-Good-Damper was named for the practice of locals killing Aboriginal people by lacing sacks of flour with poison; the Aboriginal people were forced to steal flour for food as settlers destroyed and displaced them from their hunting grounds. In the 1850s, a Spring Vale Hotel was built by Matthew Bergin near a newly surveyed route between Oakleigh and Dandenong at what is now the intersection of Princes Highway and Springvale Road. However, it did not develop into a settlement. Nearby, a blacksmith shop and a rest house for travellers was established by the Young Family. The first Springvale Post Office opened on 12 September 1864 and closed in 1892. This office had been superseded by Springvale Railway Station office (opened 1887) which was renamed Springvale in 1902. A Springvale North Post Office was also open between 1946 and 1978. In 1886, land was subdivided near the railway station and the area began to grow. By the 1920s the Spring Vale community had a lodge, brass band, a recreation reserve, a mechanics' institute, a few shops and some houses in the township. A picture theatre opened in 1924. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Springvale was a pastoral, residential and industrial township with market gardens in the surrounding areas. Sand extraction industries were active , lasting until the 1990s . The clearest indication of postwar residential growth occurred in the early 1960s when Rockman's Shopwell department store was built, and later when shops on the east side of Springvale Road were removed for road widening. Housing growth was rapid and estates with made roads and services replaced unserviced subdivisions. The new Sandown racecourse site was opened in 1961 for both horse and motor-car racing. During the 1970s and 1980s, many Vietnamese people moved to Springvale as a result of displacement during the events in the Vietnam War. Today, they make up the largest ethnic group in the area and Springvale is renown for its Vietnamese shops, markets, and community. Nonetheless, Springvale is one of the most diverse suburbs in Australia. Springvale was once a city in its own right, but a local government boundary reshuffle in December 1994, saw part of the municipality amalgamated into the City of Greater Dandenong and the rest merged into the new City of Kingston.","Sand extraction industries were active, lasting until the 1990s.","Sand extraction industries were active, lasting until the 1990s.",,
done,"Islamic banking and finance [HEAD] History ; Banking ; Since 1970 [SEP] Source: Islamic Finance Project Databank The influx of ""petro-dollars"" and a ""general re-Islamisation"" following the Yom Kippur War and 1973 oil crisis encouraged the development of the Islamic banking sector, and since 1975 it has spread globally. In 1975, the Islamic Development Bank was set up with the mission to provide funding to projects in the member countries. The first modern commercial Islamic bank, Dubai Islamic Bank, was established in 1979. The first Islamic insurance (or takaful) company — the Islamic Insurance Company of Sudan — was established in 1979. The Amana Income Fund, the world's first Islamic mutual fund (which invests only in sharia-compliant equities), was created in 1986 in Indiana. From 1980 to 1985, Islamic investments underwent a ""spectacular expansion"" throughout the Muslim world, attracting deposits with the promise of ""great gains"" and ""religious guarantees"" supplied by Islamic jurists who were ""recruited to issue fatwas denouncing conventional banks and recommending their Islamic rivals."" This growth was temporarily reversed in 1988 in the largest Arab Muslim country, Egypt, when the Egyptian state — worried that Islamist movements were building up a ""war chest"" and being given financial independence — reversed its tacit support for the industry, and launched a media campaign against Islamic banks. The ensuing financial panic led to the bankruptcy of some companies. In 1990 an accounting organization for Islamic financial institutions (Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions, AAOIFI), was established in Algiers by a group of Islamic financial institutions. Also in that year the The Islamic bond market emerged in 1990 when the first tradable sukuk — the Islamic alternative to conventional bonds — were issued by Shell MDS in Malaysia . In 2002, the Malaysia-based Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) was established as an international standard-setting body for Islamic financial institutions. By 1995, 144 Islamic financial institutions had been established worldwide, including 33 government-run banks, 40 private banks, and 71 investment companies. The large US-based Citibank began to offer Islamic banking services in 1996 when it established the Citi Islamic Investment Bank in Bahrain. The first successful benchmark for the performance of Islamic investment funds was established in 1999, with the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index (DJIMI). Also in the 1990s, a false start was made in Islamic banking in the UK, where bankers declared returns ""interest"" for tax purposes, while insisting to depositors they were actually ""profit"" and so not riba. Islamic scholars issued a fatwa stating they had ""no objection to the use of the term `interest'"" in loan contracts for purposes of tax avoidance provided the transaction did not actually involve riba, and the Islamic bankers used the term for fear that lack of tax deductions available for interest (but not profit) would put them at a competitive disadvantage to conventional banks. Muslim customers were not persuaded, and a ""bad taste"" was left ""in the mouth"" of the market for Islamic financial products. The Islamic Bank of Britain, the first Islamic commercial bank established outside the Muslim world, was not established until 2004. By 2008 Islamic banking was growing at a rate of 10–15% per year and continued growth was forecast. There were over 300 Islamic financial institutions spread over 51 countries, as well as an additional 250 mutual funds complying with Islamic principles. Worldwide, approximately 0.5% of financial assets were estimated to be under sharia-compliant management according to The Economist magazine. But as the industry grew it also drew criticism (from M.T. Usmani among others) for not progressing from ""debt-based contracts"", such as murabaha, to the more ""genuine"" profit and loss sharing mode, but instead moving in the opposite direction, ""competing to present themselves with all of the same characteristics of the conventional, interest-based marketplace"".",Also in that year the Islamic bond market emerged when the first tradable sukuk — the Islamic alternative to conventional bonds — were issued by Shell MDS in Malaysia.,The Islamic bond market emerged in 1990 when the first tradable sukuk — the Islamic alternative to conventional bonds — were issued by Shell MDS in Malaysia.,,

done,"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier [HEAD] Reception ; Critical response [SEP] The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was praised ""for bringing the Black experience to the forefront"" through its tackling of issues such as racial discrimination and confronting ""the original sins of America building itself on the backs of Black people"". David Betancourt, reviewing the season finale for The Washington Post, analyzed the racial themes surrounding the character of Sam Wilson, a Black man, acquiring the mantle of Captain America. Noting that the series was originally planned to debut in 2020, before being delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Betancourt believed there was ""something eerily timely about a Black Captain America flying in the sky days after the verdict in the murder of George Floyd"" and also pointed to Barnes potentially being in a relationship with Leah, an Asian woman, also ""at a time when Asian Americans don't feel safe in America because of racist attacks"". While these occurrences happening in the series would not ""fix anything"", Betancourt said ""you can't help but feel something when you see it"". Brian Lowry writing for CNN said, ""Overall the series deftly accomplished its primary mission, which was to explore the dramatic tension in Wilson becoming Captain America, in a way that went beyond just being told the shield now belonged to him. It also continued to demonstrate Marvel's ability to mount big, muscular action in productions for Disney+, while showcasing the depth of its universe."" Calling the series ""flawed but fun"", Brian Tallerico of Vulture stated that The Falcon and the Winter Soldier ""often felt rushed and lacked some depth in its analysis of race and power in this country"" but served its purpose as an origin story for Wilson's Captain America while setting up future MCU projects. In terms of how it would be remembered, he felt that it would be ""hard to gauge its full impact"" until its plot threads were picked up in future MCU projects, as was the case with most MCU entries. The pacing of the series received some criticism. In his review of the first episode, Alec Bojalad of Den of Geek believed releasing the series' episodes weekly was a detriment overall, since the first episode played as the first act of a larger story and felt ""frustratingly incomplete at times"" compared to how watching the full series at once would likely feel. This The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was in contrast to Marvel Studios ' first series , WandaVision , which had been "" unquestionably an episodic experience "" with each episode standing on its own and having episode television - style cliffhanger endings . By the third episode, Alan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone felt the series was ""leaning way into the 'six-hour movie' model at this point, where the only concern is advancing the plot by any means necessary, regardless of how interesting it is on its own"". He believed compared to WandaVision, which was ""very clearly built to be consumed weekly"", The Falcon and the Winter Soldier would have been better to view all at once than as weekly episodes. Sepinwall ultimately concluded The Falcon and the Winter Soldier ""was trying to do way more than it could comfortably handle"", having too many characters and plot threads that writers could not successfully execute fully, with individual episodes that felt ""sluggish"" despite a lot happening in them, because ""those various incidents don't do much beyond inching the plot forward"".","This was in contrast to Marvel Studios' first series, WandaVision, which had been ""unquestionably an episodic experience"" with each episode standing on its own and having episode television-style cliffhanger endings.","The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was in contrast to Marvel Studios' first series, WandaVision, which had been ""unquestionably an episodic experience"" with each episode standing on its own and having episode television-style cliffhanger endings.",,

done,"3-inch M1902 field gun [HEAD] Design [SEP] The features of rifling, breech loading with fixed ammunition, and a hydraulic-spring system to absorb the gun's recoil and quickly return it to the firing position combined to improve the range, accuracy, and rate of fire of the gun compared with previous weapons, allowing it to be used more effectively in operations with infantry. These new capabilities allowed the gun to provide accurate indirect fire on targets not in a direct line of sight, which provided crucial firepower for infantry attacks. It was also one of the first US artillery guns with an armored shield to protect the crew from small arms fire. The gun fired 3 inches (76 mm) steel, shrapnel, or explosive shells that weighed 15 pounds (6.8 kg).

done,"History of Freemasonry in Belgium [HEAD] The Grand Orient of Belgium ; Beginnings [SEP] The birth of the kingdom of Belgium led in 1833 to the creation of the Grand Orient of Belgium, supported by Leopold I of Belgium, who had himself been initiated in the ""Loge l'Espérance"" at Bern in 1813. It was proposed that he Leopold I of Belgium become its Serenest Grand Master , but he declined the offer and instead gave that post to baron Goswin de Stassart , one of his closest collaborators . Stassert had been initiated in Paris around 1803 and was affiliated to the ""Bonne Amitié"" lodge of Namur on 1 May 1820, then to the ""Les Amis philanthropes"" lodge on 24 June 1835. Stassart took as his special representative Théodore Verhaegen. ""La Bonne Amitié"" took number one on the tablet of the Grand Orient of Belgium until 1898, when it ceded that position to the ""Parfaite Union"" lodge of Mons. Some lodges remained faithful to the Grand-Orient des Pays-Bas -, the ""Septentrion"" in Ghent did so until 1883 and only joined the Grand Orient of Belgium late on. The lodges in Liège, Huy and Verviers created the ""Fédération maçonnique belge"" before joining the Grand Orient of Belgium in 1854. The creation of a new Grand Lodge for the new country of Belgium had rapidly caused these lodges problems over article 135 in the Masonic statutes, which forbade political and religious discussions in lodges, and they made unsuccessful attempts to have its suppressed. They then remained separate from the new Grand Lodge until the abrogation of this article in 1854. In this era lodges were filled with military officers, so much so that F. Clément protested ""…, we demand if there are still any officers in the army who have not yet been initiated""! In the wake of the encyclical Mirari Vos of 1832 and the resultant episcopal letter from cardinal Englebert Sterckx and the episcopate in 1837 banning Catholics from being or becoming Freemasons, Belgian freemasonry became less Catholic in character, though it remained deist. However, it seems that the Belgian episcopate favoured the election of Stassart as Grand Master, having initially decided that the struggle against ""Orangism"" (i.e. Protestantism) was the priority and that a freemasonry detached from Protestantism would be nominally neutral but in fact favour Catholicism. The struggle between the pro- and anti-clerical movements reached a crescendo. It had a bearing on public education, up to the point that in 1834 the ""Les Amis Philanthropes"" lodge founded the Université libre et laïque de Bruxelles, on the suggestion of Théodore Verhaegen in his discourse of 24 June 1834 to that lodge. The project then expanded massively, with several Catholic freemasons choosing freemasonry over the Catholic Church. Little by little Freemasonry came to recruit its members from the anti-clerical milieux, but the struggle was rough, as seen most of all in the changes in the Grand Lodge. For example, the old ""Bonne Amitié"" lodge at Namur came to be held at arm's length by its ""ancients"", members of the Primitive Scottish Rite, and so did not disappear despite the importance of the disaffiliations and dissensions caused by the encyclical. Other lodges, however, did not have the same opportunity. The Baron de Stassart retired as Grand Master of the Grand Orient (until then a post held for life) on 16 June 1841, following his departure as governor of the Province of Brabant for not having favoured the election of a ""Grand Maréchal du Palais"" (he made a decision of the clerical type of the ""Unionist"" government) and facing the rise to power of socio-political movements within the lodge. 6,000 people gathered in the Parc de Bruxelles to show their solidarity with him, a considerable number for this era.","It was proposed that he become its Serenest Grand Master, but he declined the offer and instead gave that post to baron Goswin de Stassart, one of his closest collaborators.","It was proposed that Leopold I of Belgium become its Serenest Grand Master, but he declined the offer and instead gave that post to baron Goswin de Stassart, one of his closest collaborators.",,

un,"Militant tendency [HEAD] Early years ; Early editions of Militant [SEP] ""Drive Out the Tories"" was the headline of the first issue of Militant, published just before the general election of 1964 with an article written by the business editor, S. Mani. Below the Militant logo were the words ""For Youth and Labour"". Inside, above the Editorial, was printed: ""Militant. Editor: Peter Taaffe (Walton Young Socialists). All correspondence to the business manager: S. Mani"". The addition of the ""Walton Young Socialists"" indicated the significance with which Taaffe and Militant viewed the young socialists, and began the practice of Militant members identifying themselves with their local Labour Party or trade union. With Taaffe in Liverpool, Roger Protz, Keith Dickinson, Ted Grant and others did most of the work on the first few issues. In the editorial of the first issue of the Militant in October 1964, Taaffe made the strategy of entryism clear: The job is to carry the message of Marxism to the ranks of the labour movement and to its young people. There is room for all tendencies in the labour movement, including the revolutionary Left. Above all the task is to gather together the most conscious elements in the labour movement to patiently explain the need for these policies on the basis of experience and events. Following the 1964 general election, which the Labour Party won with a majority of four seats, Militant called for ""No retreat by Labour"" from its promises, urging the carrying out of its promised nationalisation of steel and urban land and calling on it to ""take action against the big monopolies, combines and trusts which dominate the economy"". Under the headline, ""Another election 'pledge' broken"", Militant denounced the increased spending on nuclear weapons and their retention by the Labour Party, contrary to its commitment to nuclear disarmament. The paper supported the trade union struggle against the Labour government's incomes policy. Militant argued that the only long term solution to the problems facing working-class people was to end capitalism through a socialist transformation of society, nationally and internationally. In 1965, it demanded: ""Nationalise the 400 Monopolies"". In the meantime, Roger Protz had severed his connection with the group. A letter from Protz, written around this time, was leaked to The Observer newspaper a decade later. It recalls his experiences at an early Militant editorial board meeting: We told Grant that he was hopelessly factional and sectarian, [and] that his attitude would strangle Militant [...] He began screaming and shouting, threatening that I had no rights at all as I wasn't active in RSL, hadn't proven myself, etc. In 1969 , the Labour government came into conflict with the trade unions over its In Place of Strife white paper which was later withdrawn . Militant's national secretary Taaffe outlined how ""the trade union and Labour Movement scored a tremendous victory in forcing the Labour government to climb down over its proposed anti-trade union legislation"" in the first issue of the Militant International Review (Autumn 1969), Militant's quarterly theoretical journal. Several strikes had taken place, the ""first directly political strikes"" in what threatened to be an ""irreparable breach between the Labour leaders and their base in the Labour Movement"". Militant argued that the struggle between the Labour Party leadership and the trade unions arose from the poor economic performance of Britain compared to its competitors. For them, the ""capitalist class"" wished to make the working class pay for this ""crisis"" through a policy to restrict workers' incomes: ""For a generation now British Capitalism has been in decline... The capitalists are responsible for this mess. But they want the burdens to be borne by the working class, while their fabulous profits continue to rise. They wanted the Labour government to impose an incomes policy.""","In 1969, the Labour government came into conflict with the trade unions over its In Place of Strife white paper which was later withdrawn.","In 1969, the Labour government came into conflict with the trade unions over its In Place of Strife white paper which was later withdrawn.",,
un,"Botrychium pumicola [HEAD] Description [SEP] Botrychium pumicola is a mycorrhizal fern, and grows sporophytic gemmae (i.e., little structures for the asexual reproduction of the sporophytic, or diploid, phase of the plant's life cycle). Some botanists believe that the gemmae might be adaptations to a dry climate and fires. Another name for plants of the genus Botrychium is 'grapeferns,' since the sexual reproductive structures (synangia) look like tiny yellow-green grapes. The plant is stout, with a very congested appearance, fleshy, 8–22 cm (3–9 in) high. Leaves appear in summer. Roots are abundant, 1 mm (0.004 in) or less in diameter. The rhizome is erect, stout, elongate (2–8 cm, 1-3 in, long and 3 mm, 0.1 in, in diameter). Fronds are one or sometimes two , erect , 6–14 cm , 2 - 5½ in , long , the common stalk hypogean , 4–9 cm , 1½ - 3½ in , long and 2 - 3½ mm , 0 . 08 - 0 . 14 in , in diameter , thickly sheathed with the stems of old fronds . Trophophore is sessile or nearly so; stalk 0–10 mm, 0-0.4 in, a tenth to a half the length of trophophore rachis; blade is dull, strongly glaucous, whitish green, deltate (triangular), thickly leathery, twice pinnate, with apex bent down in vernation, 2–4 cm, 1-1½ in, long and 1½-4 cm, ½-1½ in, broad; ternate, the middle division the largest, broadly oblong to rounded-deltoid, the lateral ones similar or rhombic-oblong, all pinnately parted; pinnae closely imbricate (overlapping), up to 6 pairs, strongly ascending, sublunate to flabelliform, broadly crenate to incised, or the larger ones radially cleft into cuneiform lobes; distance between 1st and 2nd pinnae not or slightly more than between the 2nd and 3rd pairs, asymmetrically cuneate; basal pinna pair often divided into 2 unequal parts, lobed to tip, margins entire, sinuate to shallowly crenate, apex rounded to truncate, venation pinnate. The trophophore is located high on the common stalk, but the common stalk is subterranean, giving the impression that the leaf originates near ground level. Sporophore is once to thrice pinnate, with the tip recurved in vernation, sessile or short-stalked, equalling or surpassing (1 to 1½ times) the sterile blade, but with the stalk shorter than the trophophore; extremely compact sporangial cluster.","Fronds are one or sometimes two, erect, 6–14 cm, 2-5½ in, long, the common stalk hypogean, 4–9 cm, 1½-3½ in, long and 2-3½ mm, 0.08-0.14 in, in diameter, thickly sheathed with the stems of old fronds.","Fronds are one or sometimes two, erect, 6–14 cm, 2-5½ in, long, the common stalk hypogean, 4–9 cm, 1½-3½ in, long and 2-3½ mm, 0.08-0.14 in, in diameter, thickly sheathed with the stems of old fronds.",,

done,"Walter Langcake [HEAD] [SEP] Walter Langcake (21 February 1889, Warragul, Victoria – 6 June 1967, Frankston, Victoria) was an Australian woodcarver and sculptor, who specialised in ecclesiastical decorative arts. He was active between 1912 and the mid-1960s and was one of the last of the classical school of carvers produced in Australia. Many of his commissions adorn major city cathedrals, public buildings and memorials. His grandfather migrated to Victoria from England in 1852 to prospect in the Castlemaine goldfields. Although Langcake's parents were not artistic, he was apprenticed in his mid-teens to a German immigrant woodcarver. In 1913 he married Elsie Isabel Johnson and they had four daughters; one dying in infancy. As a young man he took the pledge of the Independent Order of Rechabites, which promoted temperance in Melbourne at the turn of the 20th century. His abstinence was so strict, he refused to enter public houses even for meals. Langcake was also a lifelong rationalist and became a trusted mentor to the younger anarchist writer Arthur ""Bluey"" Howells (1907–86), who was involved in the anti-Franco and pacifist movements between the wars. When Langcake's first grandson was born at the outbreak of World War II, he wryly observed ""more cannon fodder"". His original Therry st. shopfront studio off Queen Victoria Market was the unusual setting for informal gatherings of Melbourne's radicals and progressives. By the mid-30s, Langcake's business was successful enough for him to move into more upmarket premises in the Queen Street Law Chambers building. He specialised in near life-sized figures of Christ on the cross, eagle lecterns, cathedra, bas reliefs, commemorative plaques and coats of arms, but could also produce charmingly informal works, often decorative castings for hotels or unique private commissions, adorned with Australiana flora and fauna. Langcake frequently worked with the prolific church architect Louis R. Williams on major projects around Australia. He was entrusted to sculpt unique heritage logs of exceptional age (greater than 1,000 years), beauty, circumference or cultural significance. He often sourced his exotic wood from North Queensland old-growth forests. Langcake was also skilled in all aspects of cabinetry; creating fine articles of carved wooden furniture. His Walter Langcake ' s technique for alloy pieces was creation in wood and realization in cast metal , usually bronze ( e . g . the Australian American War Memorial wreath ) . the Australian American War Memorial wreath). During the 1940s he also taught woodcarving to trade students at Collingwood Technical School. Howells praised his artistry as a true sculptor in wood. In the early 1960s Langcake moved from inner Melbourne to Frankston on the Mornington Peninsula to live next to one of his daughters. His modest workshop full of wood shavings, jars of preserved insects or the odd snake, and old copies of Australian Walkabout magazine for inspiration, was built at the back of his house. He died in his sleep of a heart attack in 1967.","His technique for alloy pieces was creation in wood and realization in cast metal, usually bronze (e.g.","Walter Langcake's technique for alloy pieces was creation in wood and realization in cast metal, usually bronze (e.g. the Australian American War Memorial wreath).",,
un,"Anthrax [HEAD] Society and culture ; Biological warfare ; Sverdlovsk incident (2 April 1979) [SEP] Despite signing the 1972 agreement to end bioweapon production, the government of the Soviet Union had an active bioweapons program that included the production of hundreds of tons of anthrax after this period. On 2 April 1979, some of the over one million people living in Sverdlovsk (now called Ekaterinburg, Russia), about 1,370 kilometres (850 mi) east of Moscow, were exposed to an accidental release of anthrax from a biological weapons complex located near there. At least 94 people were infected , of whom at least 68 died . One victim died four days after the release, 10 over an eight-day period at the peak of the deaths, and the last six weeks later. Extensive cleanup, vaccinations, and medical interventions managed to save about 30 of the victims. Extensive cover-ups and destruction of records by the KGB continued from 1979 until Russian President Boris Yeltsin admitted this anthrax accident in 1992. Jeanne Guillemin reported in 1999 that a combined Russian and United States team investigated the accident in 1992. Nearly all of the night-shift workers of a ceramics plant directly across the street from the biological facility (compound 19) became infected, and most died. Since most were men, some NATO governments suspected the Soviet Union had developed a sex-specific weapon. The government blamed the outbreak on the consumption of anthrax-tainted meat, and ordered the confiscation of all uninspected meat that entered the city. They also ordered all stray dogs to be shot and people not have contact with sick animals. Also, a voluntary evacuation and anthrax vaccination program was established for people from 18 to 55. To support the cover-up story, Soviet medical and legal journals published articles about an outbreak in livestock that caused GI anthrax in people having consumed infected meat, and cutaneous anthrax in people having come into contact with the animals. All medical and public health records were confiscated by the KGB. In addition to the medical problems the outbreak caused, it also prompted Western countries to be more suspicious of a covert Soviet bioweapons program and to increase their surveillance of suspected sites. In 1986, the US government was allowed to investigate the incident, and concluded the exposure was from aerosol anthrax from a military weapons facility. In 1992, President Yeltsin admitted he was ""absolutely certain"" that ""rumors"" about the Soviet Union violating the 1972 Bioweapons Treaty were true. The Soviet Union, like the US and UK, had agreed to submit information to the UN about their bioweapons programs, but omitted known facilities and never acknowledged their weapons program.","At least 94 people were infected, of whom at least 68 died.","At least 94 people were infected, of whom at least 68 died.",,

It was watched by 5.73 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, despite airing simultaneously with Desperate Housewives on ABC, The Good Wife on CBS and Sunday Night Football on NBC. The episode also "" Stewie Goes for a Drive "" of the American animated sitcom , Family Guy , acquired a 3 . 0 / 7 rating in the 18–49 demographic , beating Allen Gregory and American Dad , in addition to significantly edging out both shows in total viewership . The episode's ratings decreased somewhat from the previous week's episode, ""Screams of Silence: The Story of Brenda Q"". Reviews of the episode were mostly mixed, calling the storyline a ""much less extreme reversal"" of the season two episode ""The Story on Page One"", in which Peter attempts to seduce actor Luke Perry. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote of the episode, ""It was disappointing to see Family Guy bury a guest star like Kaitlin Olson in the background for much of her episode as Quagmire's sister last week, but it was even worse to see the show waste Ryan Reynolds."" He continued, ""He may not fit an empirical definition of a movie star, but I think he’s worth more as a guest than a tired trope like playing himself as a sexual predator towards Peter."" McFarland also criticized the episode's two storylines, noting, ""Both plots paint themselves into a corner with no time to get out. In the third act, Stewie is trapped at Consuela's house and Peter hadn't succumbed to Reynolds' repetitive and slowly escalating advances or done anything about them, so the show snaps its fingers and ends each one prematurely."" He graded the episode as a C-. In a much more positive review, Terron R. Moore of Ology criticized the episode for not featuring Griffin family siblings Chris and Meg, but praised the series for adopting a Stewie-centric storyline. Moore noted of the storyline involving Reynolds, ""All pretty funny stuff, but Ryan Reynolds' entire guest slot is based on the fact that you like Ryan Reynolds and his occasionally homoerotic humor, which I can definitely appreciate."" He concluded his review by writing, ""Not the best Family Guy, but a definite improvement on the week before, using some of the elements it knows best."" Andy Neuenschwander of Yidio also gave mixed reaction to the episode, writing, ""Something happens whenever a celebrity shows up on ""Family Guy"" and plays themselves. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everything just feels a bit off. This episode, which featured Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds, only confirmed that feeling."" He also compared it to The Simpsons, noting, ""Maybe it's the way the celebrity is treated as a character: in shows like The Simpsons, celebrities who play themselves appear as a relatively normal version of themselves [...] But on Family Guy, celebrities tend to appear as some bizarro version of themselves.""","The episode also acquired a 3.0/7 rating in the 18–49 demographic, beating Allen Gregory and American Dad, in addition to significantly edging out both shows in total viewership.","The episode ""Stewie Goes for a Drive"" of the American animated sitcom, Family Guy, acquired a 3.0/7 rating in the 18–49 demographic, beating Allen Gregory and American Dad, in addition to significantly edging out both shows in total viewership.",,

imp,"M1 carbine [HEAD] Production [SEP] A total of over 6.1 million M1 carbines of various models were manufactured, making it the most produced small arm for the American military during World War II (compared with about 5.4 million M1 rifles and about 1.3 million Thompson submachine guns). Despite being designed by Winchester, the great majority of these were made by other companies (see § Military contractors below). The largest producer was the Inland division of General Motors, but many others were made by contractors as diverse as IBM, the Underwood Typewriter Company, and Rock-Ola Manufacturing Corporation. Few contractors made all the parts for carbines bearing their names: some makers bought parts from other major contractors or sub-contracted minor parts to companies like Marlin Firearms or Auto-Ordnance. Parts by all makers were required to be interchangeable. Often one company would get ahead or behind in production and parts would be shipped from one company to the other to help them catch up on their quota. When receivers were shipped for this purpose the manufacturers would often mark them for both companies . Some of the strangest combinations were the M1's made by the combined efforts of Underwood and Quality Hardware, resulting in the manufacturer mark UN-QUALITY. The receiver was subcontracted from Union Switch and Signal, not Underwood. Many carbines were refurbished at several arsenals after the war, with many parts interchanged from original maker carbines. True untouched war production carbines, therefore, are the most desirable for collectors. The M1 carbine was also one of the most cost effective weapons used by the United States military during World War II. At the beginning of World War II the average production cost for an M1 carbine was approximately $45, about half the cost of an M1 rifle at approximately $85 and about a fifth of the cost of a Thompson submachine gun at approximately $225. The .30 Caliber carbine ammunition was also far cheaper to produce than the standard .30-06 ammunition; used fewer resources, was smaller, lighter, faster and easier to make. These were major factors in the United States military decision to adopt the M1 carbine, especially when considering the vast numbers of weapons and ammunition manufactured and transported by the United States during World War II.",When receivers were shipped for this purpose the manufacturers would often mark them for both companies.,When receivers were shipped for this purpose the manufacturers would often mark them for both companies.,,
done,"High Level Bridge (Edmonton) [HEAD] Modifications [SEP] On November 19, 1980 two-way traffic on the High Level and Walterdale bridges changed to one-way traffic (northbound for the Walterdale Bridge, and southbound for the High Level Bridge) as a part of ""Project Uni"", with the intentions of better utilizing the two bridges. As trolley buses formerly traveled in both directions over the Walterdale bridge, this required the addition of electrical wires above the traffic deck on the High Level Bridge to facilitate these buses. Trolley bus service started on the bridge on May 4, 1981, after the addition of the wires. The wires were suspended from a wide corrugated panel that prevented the poles on the buses from getting damaged by the bridge members if they were to become disconnected. After trolley bus service was discontinued in 2009, the electrical wires and panel supporting trolley bus operation on the bridge were removed. Extensive repairs and the addition and widening of pedestrian sidewalks were completed in 1994–95. The original lead paint on the bridge was carefully removed, and over 100,000 litres of paint were used to recoat the girders. Completion of new suicide barriers in July 2016 have lowered suicide attempts by 50 percent. However, the barriers, which ended up appearing to be twice the width of the initial approved design and placed on the inside of the existing shared use path railing, reduced the west shared use path width to 2.8 metres (9.2 ft) and the east shared use path to a substandard width of 2.3 metres (7.5 ft). A feasibility study commissioned by the city found that it would be ""marginally feasible"" to widen the existing shared use paths on the bridge, at a cost of approximately $23.7 million, however no changes have been approved. An engineering study released in February 2018 explained that, even though the bridge was built to support freight trains, it would not be able to structurally support modifications to allow a new LRT line to be built on the top deck, due to corrosion. This led to the city placing a hold on plans for the future Centre LRT Line to cross the North Saskatchewan. By the time the City of Edmonton took ownership of the bridge, the main trusses had lost approximately 44 percent of their width due to rust. Repainting and other maintenance of the bridge slowed the corrosion; It is estimated that during the last 25 years the trusses have lost only an additional 5 percent of their widths. Railway stringers and floor beams on the top deck have lost approximately 42 percent and 50 percent of their original widths, respectively. Even though the bridge High Level Bridge in Edmonton , Alberta cannot support additional load , the bridge was still deemed safe for the current load . In April 2013, a campaign called ""Light the Bridge"" was launched, with the aim of covering the bridge with LED lights so it can light up on special occasions. The campaign raised approximately $2.5 million for the project, which was unveiled on July 1, 2014. The official lighting of the bridge was synchronized to the tune of ""O Canada"", played by the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and broadcast on CKUA radio. The lights are capable of displaying many different colours and are often programmed to coordinate with local events, such as green and gold for games played by the Edmonton Elks.","Even though the bridge cannot support additional load, the bridge was still deemed safe for the current load.","Even though the High Level Bridge in Edmonton, Alberta cannot support additional load, the bridge was still deemed safe for the current load.",,
un,"Nike sweatshops [HEAD] Advocacy efforts [SEP] The goals of transnational advocacy groups working on behalf of Nike factory workers are to allow workers to obtain higher wages, improve the working conditions of the factories, enable them to organize, and gain the respect of their employers. Global efforts have increased the information being spread about Nike sweatshop conditions . Countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Belgium, where no Nike factories exist, have branches of organizations that work to better factory conditions. In countries like Indonesia, Thailand, Mexico, and Cambodia, where factories are common, non-governmental organizations push anti-Nike efforts by informing the public through the media of the work environment within the plants. Several well-known advocacy groups are the Global Exchange (United States), Christian Aid (United Kingdom), The Ethical Shopper (New Zealand), and the Clean Clothes Campaign (Europe). There are several types of advocacy groups, ranging from human rights organizations, to religious groups, to labor associations. Advocacy groups function through donations, fundraising, and in some cases governmental funding. A majority of them create informational hand-outs that they distribute to citizens through the mail or at events. There has been a rapid increase in the use of the Internet as a means of distributing information between advocacy groups. The spread of news across national boundaries allows the groups to mobilize and unify campaigns. The main focus of political efforts within the countries that house the factories is an increase in the minimum wage for workers. In Indonesia, other legislative efforts included limits on the number of hours a person can work per day, mandated rest periods, minimum age requirements, and a maternity leave for women. Restrictions on labor activism and labor unions limits the amount of unification workers can develop within the factories. When laws in Indonesia were lifted in the late 1980s, factory workers and non-governmental organizations staged many strikes at Nike factories protesting the poor working conditions. The organizations also worked with international allies such as the United States to bring about awareness in foreign, and often wealthier, countries. These allies provided aide for the workers who were not paid while on strike. The non-governmental organizations within the country have less of an impact on their government’s view of the protest, but the groups outside of the country have a stronger political pull because of their wealth.",Global efforts have increased the information being spread about Nike sweatshop conditions.,Global efforts have increased the information being spread about Nike sweatshop conditions.,,
un,"Colditz Cock [HEAD] Construction [SEP] The team was headed by Bill Goldfinch and Jack Best. Goldfinch and Best were aided by their discovery in the prison library of Aircraft Design, a two-volume work by C.H. Latimer-Needham which explained the necessary physics and engineering and included a detailed diagram of a wing section. The glider was assembled by Goldfinch and Best and 12 assistants known as ""apostles"", in the lower attic above the chapel. Future RAF Air commodore Geoffrey D. Stephenson assisted in the project. The 60 ft long runway was to be constructed from tables and the glider was to be launched using a pulley system based on a falling metal bathtub full of concrete, using a gravity-assisted acceleration to 30 mph (50 km/h). The officers who took part in the project built a false wall to hide the secret space in the attic where they slowly built the glider from stolen pieces of wood. Since the Germans were accustomed to looking down for tunnels, not up for secret workshops, the officers felt quite safe from detection. Nevertheless, they placed many lookouts and created an electric alarm system to warn the builders of approaching guards. Over thirty ribs had to be constructed (around a third being structural compression ribs), predominantly formed from bed slats, but also from every other piece of wood the POWs could surreptitiously obtain. The wing spars were constructed from floor boards. Control wires were made from electrical wiring in unused portions of the castle. A glider expert, Lorne Welch, was asked to review the stress diagrams and calculations made by Goldfinch. The glider constructed was a lightweight, two-seater, high wing, monoplane design. It had a Mooney-style rudder and square elevators. The wingspan, tip to tip, was 32 ft (9.75 m), and it was 19 ft 9 in (6 m) from nose to tail. Prison sleeping bags of blue and white checked cotton were used to skin the glider, and German ration millet was boiled and used as a form of dope to seal the cloth pores. The completed glider weighed 240 lb (109 kg). The take-off was scheduled for the spring of 1945 during an air raid blackout but by then the Allied guns could be heard and the war's outcome was fairly certain. The British escape officer decided that the glider should be available for use in case the SS ordered the massacre of the prisoners as a way to get a message out to approaching American troops. The glider was approaching completion when the American Army liberated the prisoners on 16 April 1945. Although the Colditz Cock never flew in real life, the concept was fictionalized, depicting a successful flight and escape, in the 1971 TV film The Birdmen starring Doug McClure, Chuck Connors, René Auberjonois and Richard Basehart. One episode of the BBC TV series Colditz depicts the decision to build a glider as an escape attempt . It is also depicted in the final escape from Colditz Castle in the fictional story depicted in the 2002 video game Prisoner of War. The fate of the glider is not known, but the castle was in the zone controlled by the Soviets, who did not co-operate with its reclamation.

The by-election was won by the Home Rule candidate, James Delahunty. A Home Rule meeting in Dungarvan on 2 January 1877 endorsed the candidacy of James Esmonde, Kilkenny landlord and brother of the deceased MP, ahead of those of Delahunty, Denis Joseph Rearden and G. C. P. Fitzgerald. When the meeting had asked candidates to stand down if not endorsed by it, Delahunty had declined to give such an undertaking.

done,"No contest (combat sports) [HEAD] Boxing [SEP] In the 19th and early parts of the 20th century, many countries (and some parts of the United States) officially banned boxing, and occasionally the police would step in to shut down the bouts (which, although unlawful, were still sanctioned by regional boxing commissions). Since boxing is now lawful virtually anywhere in the world, the number of fights called no contest has decreased dramatically since the beginning of the 20th century. Referees were also known to stop bouts during this period when they felt bouts were too slow due to lack of aggression from one or both boxers. In the modern game, the various rules that dictate whether a fight should be called a no contest, a disqualification, or a knockout differ between countries and boxing organizations. Rules in the United States now dictate that any bout which ends prior to the completion of the 4th round, due to an accidental headbutt, is to be declared a no contest. Prior to this, accidental headbutt stoppages had been ruled a technical draw. Most other no contests in boxing occur when unusual circumstances, which would include instances such as an outdoor bout being rained out, the ring falling apart, or an unexpected injury caused by something outside of the boxer's control. One good example of an unusual circumstance occurred in 1983, on the undercard of the fight where Roberto Durán beat Davey Moore for the World Jr. Middleweight title at the Madison Square Garden, when Luis Resto and Billy Collins Jr boxed ten rounds. In 1983 , Luis Resto appeared to win the fight cleanly , and the scorers gave the match to Resto . But, it was later discovered that he had cheated by tampering with his gloves before the fight. The injuries Collins received affected his sight, and, upon finding out what Resto and his corner had done, the New York State Athletic Commission decided to change the result of the fight to a no contest. On August 28, 1998, Bernard Hopkins fought Robert Allen in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. The fight was ruled a no contest when Hopkins was injured after he was accidentally pushed out of the ring by referee Mills Lane as Lane was trying to break up a clinch.","Resto appeared to win the fight cleanly, and the scorers gave the match to Resto.","In 1983, Luis Resto appeared to win the fight cleanly, and the scorers gave the match to Resto.",,
done,"Battle of Ridgefield [HEAD] Ridgefield [SEP] Tryon was alerted to the presence of the Americans in Bethel around 1 am on April 27, cutting short thoughts of remaining for another day in Danbury. Rousing the troops, he ordered the houses of Patriots to be burned; in all, more than twenty structures were destroyed. The troops then left Danbury around dawn, and marched south toward the village of Ridgefield in an attempt to avoid General Wooster's force. Hoping to delay General Tryon until overwhelming reinforcements arrived, General Wooster split his force. The main body, about 400 men, went with Generals Arnold and Silliman across the countryside to Ridgefield, where they were met by another 100 militiamen, and erected crude barricades on the road through town. General Wooster personally chased after the British column with the remaining 200; his effort was assisted by local Patriots who created impediments before the British column, including the destruction of at least one bridge. Taking advantage of the element of surprise, Wooster engaged Tryon's rear guard as it paused for breakfast about 3 miles (4.8 km) north of the town of Ridgefield, killing at least two British soldiers. Wooster took about forty prisoners in this first engagement, and then retreated for cover in nearby woods. He struck again an hour later, but the British were more prepared for a second engagement, having positioned three artillery pieces with their rear guard, spraying the colonials with grape shot. Rallying his men, the 67-year-old General Wooster was mortally wounded moments after yelling ""Come on my boys! Never mind such random shots!"" about 2 miles (3.2 km) from Ridgefield's town center; his inexperienced militia dissolved in confusion. Wooster died five days later in Danbury at the home of Nehemiah Dibble, whose house had also served as General Tryon's temporary quarters in Danbury. General James Wooster ' s last words were reported to be "" I am dying , but with a strong hope and persuasion that my country will gain her independence . "" Wooster's harassment of the British column had provided enough time for Arnold and Silliman to prepare a crude defensive position at Ridgefield. The British column arrived at the base of Arnold's barricade at the northern end of Ridgefield's town center sometime after noon. Following an hour-long artillery barrage of the barricade, Tryon dispatched flanking parties to test both sides of the American position. Having anticipated this move, General Silliman posted forces at both flanks that blunted initial thrusts. Outnumbering the Patriot forces by more than three to one, Tryon chose to advance on all three fronts including a 600-man column under covering artillery fire against the barricade itself under the leadership of General Erskine. Tryon directed General Agnew to send out flankers, whose enfilading fire helped breach the barricade. The British then pursued the Patriot forces in a running battle the length of Town Street, and gained control of the town. With 12 dead and 24 wounded, the Americans withdrew under General Arnold's orders. After the barricade was breached, Arnold was positioned between his men and an advancing enemy platoon when his horse was struck by nine musket shots. The horse went down, and Arnold was pinned and tangled in its trappings. A British soldier charged him shouting for Arnold to surrender. Arnold shouted ""Not Yet"" and shot and killed the soldier. He then ran off with his troops with a slightly injured leg. This entire engagement took around fifteen minutes.","Wooster's last words were reported to be ""I am dying, but with a strong hope and persuasion that my country will gain her independence.""","General James Wooster's last words were reported to be ""I am dying, but with a strong hope and persuasion that my country will gain her independence.""",,

He started sailing in the French Royal Navy in 1774 as a boy, serving on the corvette Flèche, the frigates Flore and Sultane, and the ship of the line Tonnant in 1778. He took part in the Battle of Grenada. Senez was then employed in the merchant navy and on various privateers. On 3 February 1794, he joined the Navy of the Republic as an Enseigne de vaisseau non entretenu on the fluyt Dordogne in a squadron under Captain Leissègues, tasked with retaking Guadeloupe from the British. On 11 July 1794, he was given command of Fort de l'Union at Guadeloupe. Promoted to Lieutenant on 8 October 1794, he was appointed to the command of corvette Décius. In November 1796, Décius, Vaillante, and three schooners sailed for a raid on British-held Anguilla. On 27 November, HMS Lapwing intercepted the flotilla, destroying Vaillante and capturing Décius, only to scuttle her the next day to escape two French frigates. Freed by 2 January 1798, Senez was promoted to Commander (Capitaine de frégate) and given command of Vénus . On 9 October 1799, Senez transferred to the corvette Berceau. On 13 July 1800, Berceau engaged two Portuguese corvettes and five Letters or Marque, sinking one corvette and capturing four of the privateers. He fought a notable action against USS Boston on 13 October 1800, where he was taken prisoner. Returned from America, Senez was promoted to Captain 2nd class on 24 September 1803 and given command of the frigate French frigate Cybèle (2). On 29 August, he was given command of the 74-gun Borée and fought in several campaigns, notably Ganteaume's expedition to Corfu and the Battle of Maguelone in October 1809. On 5 February 1804, he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour, and on 14 June, promoted to Officer. In January 1813, Senez was given command of Ville de Marseille. At the Bourbon Restoration, he was tasked with ferrying Duke Louis Philippe d'Orléans from Palermo to France. On 5 July 1815, he was made a Knight in the Order of Saint Louis. Siding with Napoléon during the Hundred Days, Senez was given command of the frigate Dryade, and tasked with ferrying Letizia Ramolino, Joseph Fesch and Napoleon II to France.

un,"Keith Sutton [HEAD] Life and work [SEP] Keith Sutton was born in Dulwich on 29 May 1924, the younger son of George William Sutton and Audrey Pearl Dewar. He was educated at Rutlish School, Merton, leaving at age 16 to attend Wimbledon School of Art. Called up into the RNVR in July 1943, he served until January 1947 as acting sub-lieutenant. On release he returned to Wimbledon until he won the Alfred Rich scholarship to the Slade School in 1948. Fellow students in his year included Martin Froy and Peter Snow, while he formed particular friendships with entrants the following year including Victor Willing and Michael Andrews and, later, Paula Rego. He was awarded the Tonks prize for drawing, gained his Diploma in 1951 and then stayed on for an extra year. In the 1950s there were few openings for young artists apart from teaching and Sutton took up several such opportunities during the next few years while always continuing to paint and draw. He would sometimes stay with Victor Willing and his first wife Hazel at Shalford, near Guildford and there are landscapes and drawings from there. By 1955 he was writing art criticism for Art News and Review and this continued until 1957. In February–March 1958 he had his first one-man show at the Galerie de Seine in West Halkin Street. He showed twenty four paintings dating from the previous three or four years as well as a portfolio of drawings. There were favourable reviews and some sales though several paintings remain to the estate. In 1959 he carried out a commission for two glass mosaic murals for the A.E.I. Research Laboratories at Harlow . At the end of the fifties Sutton was living in University Mansions, Putney and then for a while in the house of Ronald Alley, the art historian, in Deodar Road. Here he produced his first efforts at collage. In 1963 he moved back to central London into a flat in Winchester Road, Swiss Cottage, remaining there until 1967. He continued to write art criticism during the first half of the sixties: for The New Statesman; for The Listener (alternating with David Sylvester) and also, anonymously, for The Times. He wrote several introductions in catalogues of artists' exhibitions: the sculptor George Fullard; Derek Hirst; Thomas Erma, and Trevor Bates. His monograph on Picasso was published in 1962. In 1965 he was put in charge of the arts section of the newly launched magazine London Life, continuing until it ceased publication two years later. He also continued with teaching, now at the Bath Academy, Corsham Court (1963–64). In 1960 he had stayed with Victor Willing and Paula Rego in Portugal and he felt that the new experiences of sea and landscape infused the smaller still lifes among the paint and collage works on which he now embarked. Also influential were his new friendships with the American artists Paul Jenkins and Alice Baber, and the young Thomas Erma. He took lengthy working stays in Paris in their company in 1961-2, producing there many of the 22 collages which he was to show at the Hanover Gallery in September 1962. Among the most successful of the works were the tondos, partly inspired by the artist's admiration of the Botticelli tondo The Adoration of the Kings in the National Gallery. Sutton had formed a close friendship with Tom Erma and was devastated when he heard of his never-fully-explained death from gunshot wounds in Paris in 1964, aged only 25. In 1967 his life was further disrupted as the house in Winchester Road was due for demolition to allow the construction of the Swiss Cottage library and swimming baths.

done,"Silver Apples of the Moon (Morton Subotnick album) [HEAD] Composition [SEP] The record is considered to be experimental in style. According to writer Kevin Lozano, the sounds on Silver Apples of the Moon resemble ""the byproduct of an experiment gone wrong: Its eerie tones, elliptical pulses, enigmatic thumps, and waves of cybertronic wails are still otherworldly."" Unlike other contemporary synthesizer works, the album incorporates hooks into its experimentation with ostinatos and riffs. The usage of the Buchla 100 also enabled the album's improvisatory feel, highlighting the influence of Pauline Oliveros' ""intuitive approach"". Oliveros, one of Subotnick's colleagues, later said of his music from the period: ""Sequencing now is something anyone can do anytime, anywhere. But this was the first time that you could do it in this way. He certainly made a great use of it and advised [Buchla] in that direction, I'm sure. Because before that, he was cutting and splicing tape."" Running for over sixteen minutes, ""Part I"" is a slow, moody section, incorporating 'pinprick' tones which move around the stereo field, and calm passages which are abruptly interrupted by electronic noise. The track makes wide-ranging usage of glissandi, whistles, sirens and other sounds and tones, and also incorporates irregular sections and ""capricious shapes."" The ""atomized melodies, eerie sighs [and] hissing explosions of sound"" are reminiscent of early electronic compositions by Milton Babbitt and Karlheinz Stockhausen. The introduction to the piece, featuring undulating pitches that rise and fall, was the first part of the album recorded. A rhythm in the middle of the track emerges alongside numerous high-pitched melodies atop underlying minimal noise, while the coda features low and slow bass tones. By contrast , "" Part II "" of the album Silver Apples of the Moon opens with high - pitched "" ding - y "" sounds that Morton Subotnick referred to as the sound of "" silver apples , "" and develops a pulse before climaxing with frenzied "" proto - club rhythms , "" with sequences pasted over a steady ostinato . Beeps and bleeps are played atop the sequenced phrases. Underlying the track is an ever-rising whirring that varies in pitch against numerous sounds which ""flash"" in and out of the piece. Sequenced synthesizer phrases were an innovation at the time. According to writer Alfred Hickling, ""[t]his had simply never been heard before. Early electronic compositions were mostly about sine waves, oscillations, timbre – all devoid of rhythm, by and large."" Subotnick nonetheless said his discovery of beats happened almost by accident: ""In the early days, it took a long, long time – sometimes even days – to programme a sequence. Quite unintentionally, I found I had created this pulsating rhythm. I started grooving with it – and it blew my mind.""","By contrast, ""Part II"" opens with high-pitched ""ding-y"" sounds that Subotnick referred to as the sound of ""silver apples,"" and develops a pulse before climaxing with frenzied ""proto-club rhythms,"" with sequences pasted over a steady ostinato.","""Part II"" of the album Silver Apples of the Moon opens with high-pitched ""ding-y"" sounds that Morton Subotnick referred to as the sound of ""silver apples,"" and develops a pulse before climaxing with frenzied ""proto-club rhythms,"" with sequences pasted over a steady ostinato.",,

During his brief 15-year career, he penned the scripts for 24 films, as well as producing over 20 film shorts. In 1935, he began work on a script entitled Harlem Cavalcade. He authored another half-dozen films during the remaining years of the 1930s, before devoting his efforts full-time to this manuscript.

done,"Michiel Coignet [HEAD] Life [SEP] Michiel Coignet’s father Gillis (also known as Egidius) was a goldsmith and maker of astronomical and mathematical instruments in Antwerp and was married to Brigitte Anthonis Hendriks. Michiel’s brother Jacob III became a physician while his brother Gillis I became a painter. Michiel’s father died in 1562-1563. The details on Michiel’s education are scarce. He was admitted to the St Ambrose Guild of School Teachers in 1568. He taught French and mathematics. It is likely that at the time he started working as a teacher he had already studied higher mathematics since the mathematics class he taught was referred to as 'mathematicam' whereas lower mathematics was referred to as 'cijfferen' (calculation). He married Maria vanden Eynde c. 1570 and the couple would have 10 children. Only their son Antonius was still alive at the time of his death. In 1572-73 Michiel Coignet was appointed by the city as 'wijnroeier' ('wine gauger'). The wijnroeier was a municipal employee tasked with measuring the wine barrels that arrived in the city in order to calculate the taxes due. From the year 1572 also dates Michiel’s first signed instrument, an astrolabium. This is an indication that his mother likely kept her deceased husband’s workshop in operation until her son could become a master of the Guild of Saint Luke. Michiel Coignet became a member of the Guild of Saint Luke as the son of a member in 1581 and became a full master in 1589 after a period of apprenticeship . He also became a member of the Guild of Meerse, which was the guild of the shopkeepers and wine gaugers. Michiel Coignet converted to the Protestant faith. After the Fall of Antwerp in 1585, he joined a local schutterij called the 'kolveniersgilde'. Since only Catholics were typically allowed to join the schutterij it is assumed that he had reconverted to Catholicism. His brother Gillis, however, did not and emigrated to Amsterdam where he had a successful career as an artist. In 1585 Coignet stopped teaching except for classes for military officers and sons of prosperous merchants. Michiel Coignet remained in this position of 'wijnroeier' until he started his service as a mathematician and engineer for the Archdukes in 1596. He would remain in court service until his death in 1623. In 1604 Coignet received a further stipend from the court for his role as of cosmographer. In 1606, he remarried after the death of his first wife in November 1605 and had four children from this second marriage. One of them was the painter Michiel II Coignet (1618-1663). In the summer of 1623 Coignet made a request to the Archduchess Isabella to get a pension. She yielded his request and decided to grant him a single lump sum for his services. However, Coignet died before the sum was paid. The Archduchess Isabella wanted to have his works published, but this plan was not realized.",Michiel became a member of the Guild as the son of a member in 1581 and became a full master in 1589 after a period of apprenticeship.,Michiel Coignet became a member of the Guild of Saint Luke as the son of a member in 1581 and became a full master in 1589 after a period of apprenticeship.,,

The site was acquired by Léon Gaumont in 1907 and converted into a cinema. It remained part of the Gaumont Film Company empire throughout its history. In 1931 Gaumont reconstructed the cinema, with a new Art Deco exterior. The largest cinema in France, it was used to premiere major productions from both France and abroad. With a capacity of 6,000 it commonly attracted between fifty and sixty thousand spectators a week in the early 1930s. The size of the cinema meant it rarely held films over for more than two weeks before they were switched to smaller venues in the city such as the Caméo cinema. In 1952 the cinema featured in the comedy film Holiday for Henrietta. In 1962 it was converted for the use of Cinerama widescreen format.

Doney, in the Grande vie des saints (1872) wrote, Saint Tygrius et Saint Eutrope, Martyrs The chance of birth seemed to have never separated these two holy characters, united by the defense of the same interests, and the glory of a common martyrdom. Tygrius was born among the barbarians who conquered the Roman Empire. Having been taken prisoner in his youth, he was sold as a slave to a rich and powerful man from Constantinople who gave him freedom, as a reward for his zeal in serving him. His piety and virtues then brought him into the ecclesiastical state, and elevated him to the priesthood. Tygrius was so gentle and so fervent in piety, that in a short time he attracted the esteem and affection of the clergy and people of Constantinople. St. John Chrysostom also knew how to appreciate his rare virtue, gave him his confidence, and lived with him in a very close friendship. This honorable friendship exposed Tygrius to the persecutions of the enemies of the holy Patriarch , and when Theophilus of Alexandria convened , in a suburb of Chalcedon , the famous Synod of the Oak , which condemned in such an unjust and odious manner this eloquent doctor of the Church , he himself was summoned to appear before these passionate and prevaricating judges , and condemned as one of the most devoted supporters of John Chrysostom . Eutrope, a lector (reader) of the church of Constantinople, belonged to one of the patrician families of that city. He was a young man of very delicate complexion, who had received a distinguished education, and who had already been distinguished by the sanctity of his life when the opportunity presented itself for him to deploy a firmness. and an invincible courage to the most cruel supplications. At the time when St. Chrysostom was expelled for the second time from Constantinople, a fire broke out, it is not known by what accident, in the patriarchal church of Hagia Sophia, and the hall where the senate met. The governor of the city, Optat, who was still a pagan, was charmed to find, in this fortuitous event, a pretext for raging against these men who by their virtues and lights attracted new proselytes to the religion of Jesus Christ every day, and aroused in them, on this occasion, violent persecutions which the weakness of the children of the great and pious Theodosius were incapable of repressing. The lector Eutrope and the priest Tygrius, both guilty of too ardent a zeal for religion and too much devotion to the banished patriarch, were the first to be arrested. Eutrope was first tortured to force him to reveal the perpetrators of the fire. But this cruelty only served to explode, in the person of this frail young man, the power of the One who knows how to make the weakest instruments confound the strongest.","This honorable friendship exposed Tygrius to the persecutions of the enemies of the holy Patriarch, and when Theophilus of Alexandria convened, in a suburb of Chalcedon, the famous Synod of the Oak, which condemned in such an unjust and odious manner this eloquent doctor of the Church, he himself was summoned to appear before these passionate and prevaricating judges, and condemned as one of the most devoted supporters of John Chrysostom.","This honorable friendship exposed Tygrius to the persecutions of the enemies of the holy Patriarch, and when Theophilus of Alexandria convened, in a suburb of Chalcedon, the famous Synod of the Oak, which condemned in such an unjust and odious manner this eloquent doctor of the Church, he himself was summoned to appear before these passionate and prevaricating judges, and condemned as one of the most devoted supporters of John Chrysostom.",,

After a slow 62 second first lap, notable kicker Eamonn Coghlan rushed from the back of the field to the front, followed by mile world record holder, John Walker, but their action in the front only seemed to keep the pace slow. For another lap and a half, the field jockeyed for position for the inevitable final kick. Between 500 meters out and the bell the field bunched so it was almost four abreast across the line behind Walker and Coghlan. The bunch followed around the turn to the start line, then Walker decided to make the break, gaining a step on Coghlan with 800 meter medalists Rick Wohlhuter and Ivo Van Damme the next in line. Walker never relinquished his lead, slowly building on the gap. Behind him van Damme with Wohlhuter as his shadow, edged up on Coghlan. First Wohlhuter fell back, then Coghlan. As van Damme continued to chase Walker, Paul-Heinz Wellmann ran past the faltering athletes along the rail. A defeated Coghlan tried not to give up, dipping for the finish line in vain almost 10 meters too early. All that succeeded in doing was making him lose his balance, clearly falling to fourth place.

In 1995, CARECEN merged with GANO as both organizations had board members and goals in common. Fisher and Taafe said in the 1997 article Public Life in Gulfton: Multiple Publics and Models of Organization that the merger into GANO made cooperation between the members of the combined ""progressive"" GANO and Shenandoah Civic Association with the more ""conservative"" GAAC unlikely.

On 12 July 1925, a 660-volt third-rail system came into operation on both routes through Herne Hill, from Victoria to Orpington on the Chatham Main Line and along the entire length of the City Branch. Electric trains ran every 20 minutes on both routes during the day and were kept overnight at the sorting sidings north of the station. The distinctive signal box overlooking Norwood Road and a similar signal box at the northern end of the station were demolished in 1956 and replaced by a single signal box adjacent to the north junction. The replacement signal box was in use from June 1956 until December 1981, when its functions were transferred to Victoria; the building still exists and is used by railway staff. The signalling at Herne Hill was upgraded from semaphores to colour lights on 8 March 1959 as part of the Kent Coast electrification plan. By 1959, the pattern of commuter services at Herne Hill had taken the shape it held into the 21st century: all-stops trains from Victoria to Orpington and from the City of London to Wimbledon and Sutton (but, unlike the modern Sutton Loop, via West Croydon).

Eventually Lyudmila is partnered with a grizzled veteran sniper named Makarov, with whom she falls in love. He doesn't return her affections, however, and explains that he lost his family when the Germans invaded. She is also reunited with Masha, who is now a nurse engaged with a young pilot. While defending the city of Odessa, she is injured and Makarov drags her to safety to a local hospital, where Boris has volunteered as a military doctor. After awakening, Lyudmila manages to get Boris to sign her papers so that she can return to the front lines, but finds out that Makarov has died in battle and the Soviets are retreating to Sevastopol. Once back on the front, Lyudmila is paired with a male sniper named Leonid. She begins to wound enemy soldiers to watch them suffer, to her new partner's horror.

un,"Axanthism [HEAD] [SEP] Axanthism is a mutation that interferes with an animal's ability to produce yellow pigment. The mutation affects the amount of xanthophores and carotenoid vesicles, sometimes causing them to be completely absent. Erythrophores and iridophores , which are responsible for red coloration and light reflecting pigments respectively , may also be affected . Axanthism is most obvious in green animals, specifically amphibians, making them appear blue. Green coloration in animals is caused by iridiphores reflecting blue wavelengths of light back through the carotenoids in the xanthophores. In the absence of xanthophores and carotenoids, the blue light is unaltered and reflected back normally. Animals that are normally yellow will appear white if affected with axanthism. While axanthism commonly makes green animals blue, it can also make the animal gray or even black, making it appear as if the animal has melanism; though they can be distinguished by how axanthic animals are slightly lighter and how melanistic animals produce more melanophores. When iridophores are affected by axanthism, the animal typically becomes duller or darker in coloration due to a lesser amount of light reflected. Typically it is only the skin that is affected, and the eyes still have iridophores. The opposite of axanthism is xanthochromism, which is an excess of yellow coloration.","Erythrophores and iridophores, which are responsible for red coloration and light reflecting pigments respectively, may also be affected.","Erythrophores and iridophores, which are responsible for red coloration and light reflecting pigments respectively, may also be affected.",,

done,"Richard McKeon [HEAD] Life, times, and influences [SEP] McKeon obtained his undergraduate degree from Columbia University in 1920, graduating at the early age of 20 despite serving briefly in the U.S. Navy during the First World War. Continuing at Columbia, he completed a Master's thesis on Leo Tolstoy, Benedetto Croce, and George Santayana, also in 1920, and a doctoral thesis on Baruch Spinoza in 1922. In his doctoral studies, McKeon's mentors were Frederick J. E. Woodbridge and John Dewey. From Woodbridge, McKeon would later write, he learned that ""what philosophers meant might be comparable or even identical, despite differences in their modes of expression,"" while Dewey taught him how ""to seek the significance of philosophic positions in the problems they were constructed to solve."" He then studied philosophy in Paris, where his teachers included Étienne Gilson, until he began teaching at Columbia in 1925. In 1934, McKeon was appointed visiting professor of History at the University of Chicago, beginning a 40-year association with that university. The following year, he assumed a permanent position as professor of Greek philosophy, a post he filled for twelve years. As professor and, also starting in 1935, as Dean of the Humanities, McKeon was instrumental in developing the distinguished general education program of the Hutchins era at the University of Chicago. He later founded Chicago's interdisciplinary Committee on the Analysis of Ideas and Study of Methods. He presided over the Western division of the American Philosophical Association in 1952, and over the International Institute of Philosophy from 1953 to 1957. In 1966, he gave the Paul Carus Lectures. He retired in 1974. McKeon was a central intellectual figure in United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) early years. He advised UNESCO when (1946–48) it studied the foundations of human rights and of the idea of democracy. These studies supplied much of the material for the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. In 1954, under the auspices of UNESCO and the Indian Philosophical Congress, he conducted a series of eighteen roundtable discussions at Indian universities on human relations and international obligations. McKeon was a pioneer American scholar of medieval philosophy and the history of science. He was also a prominent figure in the revival of rhetoric as an intellectual art, exploring the often problematic relation between philosophy and rhetoric. He taught Aristotle throughout his career, insisted that his was a Greek Aristotle, not one seen through the eyes of later philosophers writing in Latin. McKeon's interests later shifted from the doctrines of individuals to the dialectic of systems. He investigated pluralism, cultural diversity, and problems of communication and community, at a time when such subjects were less than fashionable. McKeon was a founding member of ""The Chicago School"" of literary criticism because of his influence on several of its prominent members (e.g., Wayne Booth). Notwithstanding, McKeon distanced himself from ""The Chicago School,"" which was mainly concerned with Neo-Aristotelian poetic theory. As a pluralist, he wished to disassociate himself from any attempt to propagandize any particular ideology, philosophy, or theorist. A series of three volumes of ""Selected Writings"" from his widely scattered articles is planned by The University of Chicago Press, of which Vol. Vol . 1 ( "" Philosophy , Science and Culture , "" 1998 ) and Vol . 2 ( "" Culture , Education and the Arts , "" 2005 ) of Richard McKeon ' s widely scattered articles have appeared . 2 (""Culture, Education and the Arts,"" 2005) have appeared.

done,"Shulamith Firestone [HEAD] Writing ; The Dialectic of Sex [SEP] The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution (1970) became a classic text of second-wave feminism. This was Firestone's first book and was published when she was just 25. In the book, Firestone sought to develop a materialist view of history based on sex. Also notable within the book is the ideal society Firestone creates, one void of the oppression of women. 'The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution' was perceived to be a Utopian manifesto dedicated to exploring some to the contradictions present in the United States at the time to an extreme. 'The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution' was met with both applause and outrage and it even made the best sellers list. Just as to ensure elimination of economic classes requires the revolt of the underclass (the proletariat) and, in a temporary dictatorship, their seizure of the means of production, so to assure the elimination of sexual classes requires the revolt of the underclass (women) and the seizure of control of reproduction: not only the full restoration to women of ownership of their own bodies, but also their [temporary] seizure of control of human fertility—the new population biology as well as all the social institutions of child-bearing and child-rearing. ... [T]he end goal of feminist revolution must be, unlike that of the first feminist movement, not just the elimination of male privilege but of the sex distinction itself: genital differences between human beings would no longer matter culturally. Firestone synthesized the ideas of Sigmund Freud, Wilhelm Reich, Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, and Simone de Beauvoir into a radical feminist theory of politics. She also acknowledged the influence of Lincoln H. and Alice T. Day's Too Many Americans (1964) and the 1968 best-seller The Population Bomb by Paul R. Ehrlich. Within her book, Firestone asserts that modern society could not achieve true gender equality until women's biological traits are separated from their identity. The Dialectic of Sex was largely influenced by the existing views of Simone de Beauvoir. Shulamith Firestone supported the belief that the women were limited by the need for them to have children , and by reproducing they could not be individualistic . She also connected the ideas in her book to de Beauvoir's view that motherhood oppressed women, and women became victims in a patriarchal based society. Firestone believed in the importance of recognizing and creating awareness for the history and predecessors of the feminist movement, so she dedicated her book to Simone de Beauvoir. She also makes the claim that Freud and Marx had ignored what she called the “sex class”, the domination of women given their biological differences. Gender inequality stems from the patriarchal societal structures imposed upon women because of their bodies, she argued, particularly the physical, social, and psychological disadvantages caused by pregnancy, childbirth, and child-rearing. She expanded on Marx's views of class to include sex as a class, which she believed was created due to biological distinctions associated with reproduction. Just as Marx connected class differences to divisions in labour, Firestone associated the differences in the classes of sex to be caused by the division of labor and roles regarding procreation. Unlike many other feminists who argued the female existence is a superior one, Firestone only freely accepted that there are biological differences between men and women. However, she made it clear that these differences, though real, are not to be treated as a foundation for prejudice or superiority of one group over another. Firestone also insists that to be human is to outgrow nature, saying: ""we can no longer justify the maintenance of a discriminatory sex class system on the grounds of its origin in Nature."" The abolition of the sex class requires that women take control of the means of reproduction.","Firestone supported the belief that the women were limited by the need for them to have children, and by reproducing they could not be individualistic.","Shulamith Firestone supported the belief that the women were limited by the need for them to have children, and by reproducing they could not be individualistic.",,
imp,"Gunsmoke [HEAD] Television series (1955–1975) ; Character back stories [SEP] The back stories of some of the main characters were largely left to the imagination of the viewer. Matt Dillon spent his early years in foster care, knew the Bible, was a wayward, brawling cowboy, and was later mentored by a caring lawman. In a few episodes, he mentions having spent some time in the army. Kitty Russell was born in New Orleans and reared by a flashy foster mother (who once visited Dodge), although her father visited Dodge on one occasion and wished to have her return to New Orleans. Barkeep Sam is said to be married, but no wife is ever seen. Quint Asper's white father was killed by white scavengers. Thad Greenwood's father, a storekeeper, was harassed to death by a trio of loathsome ne'er-do-well thieves. Chester Goode is known to be one of many brothers raised by an aunt and uncle, and on one occasion, he mentions his mother; he refers to past service in the cavalry and years as a cattle driver in Texas. The cause of Chester's stiff right leg is never given, but it is shown as his own leg and not a prosthesis. No direct reference to his disability is ever made in the script, although some oblique moments paint the free-spirited, comic deputy with a darker tone. Newly O'Brien was named after a physician uncle who ignited his interest in medicine. While Dillon and Miss Kitty clearly have a close personal relationship, the two never marry. In a July 2, 2002, Associated Press interview with Bob Thomas, Arness explained, ""If they were man and wife, it would make a lot of difference. The people upstairs decided it was better to leave the show as it was, which I totally agreed with."" In the episode ""Waste"", featuring Johnny Whitaker as a boy with a prostitute mother, her madam questions Dillon as to why the law overlooks Miss Kitty's enterprise. Apparently , bordellos could exist "" at the law ' s discretion , "" ( meaning the marshal ' s ) . As a historical matter, prior to the First World War, few laws criminalized prostitution in the United States. The nearest that Matt and Miss Kitty have to a romantic evening together is when they try to have dinner over the Long Branch Saloon (""A Quiet Day In Dodge"", 1973). Unfortunately, Marshal Dillon has been going over 30 hours without sleep, and when Kitty is distracted, he falls soundly asleep. The nearest Miss Kitty gets to being married is when she has to pretend to be married to Cavalry Sgt. Holly to save her from a robber gang (""Sergeant Holly"", 1970). By the time of the ""Gold Train"" episode, Kitty remembers when she first met Matt – 17 years before. Miss Kitty was written out in 1974. The actress said she was tired and quit to protect the cast and crew she loved so much. When Blake decided not to return for the show's 20th (and final) season, the character was said to have returned to New Orleans. She was replaced by the hoarse-voiced, matronly actress Fran Ryan (known to many as the second Doris Ziffel on CBS's Green Acres.) For over a decade on television, a sign hung over Doc's office that read ""Dr. G. Adams"". Milburn Stone was given free rein to choose the character's first name.

imp,"Conceptions of logic [HEAD] Rival conceptions of logic [SEP] In the period of scholastic philosophy, logic was predominantly Aristotelian. Following the decline of scholasticism, logic was thought of as an affair of ideas by early modern philosophers such as Locke and Hume (1711-1716). Immanuel Kant took this one step further. He begins with the assumption of the empiricist philosophers, that all knowledge whatsoever is internal to the mind, and that we have no genuine knowledge of 'things in themselves'. Furthermore , ( an idea he seemed to have got from Hume ) the material of knowledge is a succession of separate ideas which have no intrinsic connection and thus no real unity . In order that these disparate sensations be brought into some sort of order and coherence, there must be an internal mechanism in the mind which provides the forms by which we think, perceive and reason. Kant calls these forms Categories (in a somewhat different sense than employed by the Aristotelian logicians), of which he claims there are twelve: However, this seems to be an arbitrary arrangement, driven by the desire to present a harmonious appearance than from any underlying method or system. For example, the triple nature of each division forced him to add artificial categories such as the infinite judgment. This conception of logic eventually developed into an extreme form of psychologism espoused in the nineteenth by Benno Erdmann and others. The view of historians of logic is that Kant's influence was negative. Another view of logic espoused by Hegel and others of his school (such as Lotze, Bradley, Bosanquet and others), was the 'Logic of the Pure Idea'. The central feature of this view is the identification of Logic and Metaphysics. The Universe has its origin in the categories of thought. Thought in its fullest development becomes the Absolute Idea, a divine mind evolving itself in the development of the Universe. In the modern period, Gottlob Frege said ""Just as 'beautiful' points the way for aesthetics and 'good' for ethics, so do words like 'true' for logic"", and went on characterise the distinctive task of logic ""to discern the laws of truth"". Later, W. V. Quine (1940, pp. 2–3) defined logic in terms of a logical vocabulary, which in turn is identified by an argument that the many particular vocabularies —Quine mentions geological vocabulary— are used in their particular discourses together with a common, topic-independent kernel of terms. These terms, then, constitute the logical vocabulary, and the logical truths are those truths common to all particular topics. Hofweber (2004) lists several definitions of logic, and goes on to claim that all definitions of logic are of one of four sorts. These are that logic is the study of: (i) artificial formal structures, (ii) sound inference (e.g., Poinsot), (iii) tautologies (e.g., Watts), or (iv) general features of thought (e.g., Frege). He argues then that these definitions are related to each other, but do not exhaust each other, and that an examination of formal ontology shows that these mismatches between rival definitions are due to tricky issues in ontology.","Furthermore, (an idea he seemed to have got from Hume) the material of knowledge is a succession of separate ideas which have no intrinsic connection and thus no real unity.","Furthermore, (an idea he seemed to have got from Hume) the material of knowledge is a succession of separate ideas which have no intrinsic connection and thus no real unity.",,

In c. 1835 Mrs Underwood was the owner and perhaps builder of three storey stone shops and houses each with seven rooms. By 1845 a two-storey brick house and shop with a shingle roof and five rooms was built. Also on this same allotment at the corner of George and Globe Streets a two-storey stone and brick house and store was erected. The five roomed house had ""every convenience"". In 1861 this building was used as a ""Bowling Alley"" managed by William Ogilvie. In 1871 in the tenements erected by Mrs Underwood, a public house was opened in today's No. 155 George Street, named the ""Nil Desperandum Hotel"". By 1882 three two storey tenements were erected on the north side of the Hotel, which was at this time known as the New York Hotel. These shops and dwelling were constructed of brick and they were roofed in iron. In 1891 the building to the south corner of Globe and George Street (now 145 George Street) was demolished. In 1892 a three-storey brick and slate roofed shop and dwelling was erected for the Trustees of the Church of England at 145 George Street.

The buildings just south of the subject site were demolished in 1937 and the site acquired by the Public Transport Commission in 1946 for the City Rail Link to Circular Quay, the line became operational in 1956. In 1986 plans for the development of the site, comprising 145–155 George Street and 60 Harrington Street were developed. The proposal was for the development of the Harrington Street portion of the site. The development included the construction of a ten-storey office block with retail on the ground floor and an underground carpark. The development included changes to the commercial buildings facing George Street with new shopfronts and the reconfiguring of 147 George Street as an arcade entrance for the Duty Free Store (DFS).

Individuals who automatically acquired citizenship in 2009 or 2015 because of amendments to nationality law in those years have a special route for renunciation that only requires that they are citizens of another country and costs no fees. Former citizens who renounced their nationality may subsequently apply for nationality restoration, after reacquiring permanent residency and being physically present in Canada for at least 365 days during the two-year period preceding their applications. They must also have filed income taxes for the prior year. Individuals who had their citizenships revoked are ineligible for nationality resumption and must follow the naturalization process instead. Citizenship may be revoked from individuals who fraudulently acquired it, and renunciations may be similarly rescinded from persons who provided false information during that process.

imp,"Charlie Dunn [HEAD] The Charlie Dunn method ; Fit [SEP] Ask the thousands of owners of Charlie's boots what make them special, and the constant among the many reasons offered is, ""Because of the fit."" To achieve the fit, Charlie took accurate, extensive measurements, then built a boot that held them. Charlie preferred to make measurements in person. ""Feet are like fingerprints,"" Charlie explained. ""None are the same."" A prospective client was ordered to ""just stand naturally"" in his or her sock feet, while Charlie drew with his blue pencil on a manila sheet, around and beneath each foot, all the while asking about how they would be used—to ride? dance ? stroll ? —and other relevant facts . He also probed and worked his double-jointed hands around and over each foot, making notations and marks on the diagrams. He described the process of getting the right six measurements: ""I take a double diagram, and I take notes on every little blood vessel and everything else. It takes about 10 minutes. I don't even have to see what I'm doing. My hands are so sensitive—just like a safecracker's hands—I can feel tendons right through socks and veins and joints and calluses."" He knew that to achieve the perfect fit, the boots must conform to that individual's idiosyncratic shape by making certain there was no ""pressure on the blood vessels or the tendons, otherwise 'misery' and [the] foot falls asleep."" ""I've got to know your bunions, corns, and calluses to do it right,"" he claimed. Until the 1940s, Charlie had measured clients' feet without socks on them, but the Texas legislature intervened. As Charlie recounted in the late 1970s, ""[Now] you can't take your sock off in my presence. The podiatrists got nervous about the bootmakers taking their business away, so about 30 years ago they passed a law in the Texas legislature that said you got to keep your socks on in here. They were just afraid of the boot-making profession. I called their hand on that one. I let 'em know that if I had no more faith in my trade than they had in theirs, I'd go out and dig ditches. I recommended they do the same."" Ever the one to point out nonsense, Charlie persevered to overcome this obstacle. Once he had the measurements, down to the last vein and callous, Charlie translated them to wooden lasts, foot-shaped wooden blocks. He shaped the lasts to conform to measurements by building up sections with leather strips and shaving away other areas with a scalpel knife. Charlie carefully shaped the last, explaining, ""The whole thing is built around the arch."" Not surprisingly, he used lasts of his own design (Model 100), and had them imported from Mexico, changing from Mexican ash to mesquite over time. The last generally served for seven years before being remade: ""Our feet change all the time,"" he said. ""If the customer gains—or loses—as much as 25 pounds, he must come in so I can take a new set of measurements for a new last."" Charlie was particularly protective about his measurements and lasts: ""There are some things I do that I won't even talk about because I don't want other bootmakers to know how it's done."" In an oft-repeated pronouncement, Charlie summed up the importance of the last: ""In bootmaking, the last comes first.""",dance? stroll?—and other relevant facts.,dance? stroll?—and other relevant facts.,,

The main reason for this is that it is not considered acceptable to ask football or rugby fans to sit behind an athletics track. This means that In the United Kingdom , athletics stadiums have to be separately financed and this can only be done with public funds , which have not been forthcoming on a large scale . The largest athletics stadium built in the United Kingdom between Second World War and the 2010s, the 38,000-capacity City of Manchester Stadium built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, was reconfigured for football-only use after that event. For many years, the largest existing stadium was the 25,000 seat Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield, and London's largest athletics venue was Crystal Palace, which has just 15,500 permanent seats. Both have since been superseded by the venue now known as London Stadium, which was built as an 80,000 seater for the 2012 Summer Olympics and became the new home of West Ham United F.C. in 2016. By the time West Ham moved in, the capacity was reduced to 60,000, and the track remained in place, with movable seating added to allow optimal configurations for both athletics and football. Since the retention of the track was a necessary condition for tenancy, the Olympic Stadium won the right to host the 2017 IAAF World Championships.

He was also praised for personally attending the funeral of a cousin, as at that time, chancellors often considered themselves too important to attend the funerals of distant relatives. In 796, Lu Mai suffered a stroke while at the office of the chancellors, and was taken home in a litter. He offered to resign, but Emperor Dezong declined. As Lu Zhi had by this point been demoted and exiled , Zhao had died , on an occasion when Jia was away observing a memorial for a parent , there was no chancellor on duty , and Emperor Dezong had to send eunuchs to the office of the chancellors to make sure that the affairs of the state were being attended to .

imp,"Hadži-Ruvim [HEAD] Plot against the Dahije and death [SEP] After visiting the monasteries, he returned home to Bogovađa in late autumn 1803. Meanwhile, another conspiracy letter had been written by knez Aleksa Nenadović (or prota Matija Nenadović in his name) to Austrian major Mitizer in Zemun that asked of the Austrians to prepare ammunition and officers to help them ""get rid of the Dahije"". Upon his return to Bogovađa, Hadži-Ruvim received a message from Aleksa Nenadović asking him to flee, as the Turks wrongly accused him of writing that letter to the Austrians, which was intercepted on the Sava ferry by the Dahije. The letter had been intercepted while Hadži-Ruvim was away from the Belgrade Pashalik, and his return might have been viewed by the Dahije as a signal for uprising, therefore they held him accountable. Nenadović asked Hadži-Ruvim to leave the Belgrade Pashalik once again, so as to leave suspicion solely on Nenadović, as it was believed that Hadži-Ruvim was out of danger. Hadži-Ruvim did not listen to Nenadović, whom he messaged that he ""had enough of fleeing and wandering."" After the Dahije intercepted Nenadović's letter, they increased the monitoring of Christians. They then learnt of further plans after finding a corresponding letter between the chieftains and the Ottoman government in a frisking of a priest in Ostružnica. The Dahije now took serious measures to suppress any plans, and decided to assault all notable Serbs, and to place new knezes and seniors in their place, then hold the notable Serbs as hostages until the confiscation of weapons from the rayah. They then planned to kill male adults, and employ the rest into their army and Islamize them. The Dahije began to take measures, especially in the Valjevo area. The Dahije sent secret orders to their muteselims to kill each of their knez on the given day. It seems that Mehmed-aga Fočić was tasked with overseeing the operation. The victims were obor-knezes, knezes, buljubašas and other chosen people. The killings began on 23 January. By 25 January, the Dahije decided that all notable Serbs were to be assaulted, so that what was left would become real ""rayah, to serve the Turks well"". Other Turk lords then began to attack chosen notable people in their districts. Karađorđe , who had led plans in Šumadija , survived attempts . According to contemporary accounts, heads were put on public display at the Valjevo town square to serve as an example to those who might plot against the rule of the Dahije. Metropolitan Leontius invited Hadži-Ruvim to Belgrade and asked him of the state of the people, to which he answered that no words could describe the discontent and suffering, and advised the Metropolitan that the two cross into Austria, as the people planned an uprising against the Dahije. The Metropolitan then informed the Dahije of their discussion, and the Dahije arrested Hadži-Ruvim and brought him to Kučuk-Alija on 28 January, then killed him the next day. According to Vuk Karadžić, ""they say that they dragged him with pliers and cut off his breasts and the meat below his armpits, then killed him"".

done,"Girolamini, Naples [HEAD] History [SEP] The church was built site of an earlier building, the Palazzo Seripando, which was bought in 1586 with 5500 ducats for the priests of the Congregation of the Oratory of St Philip Neri. Archbishop Mario Carafa, had requested disciples from the order, and received the future cardinal Francesco Tarugi. Once the Palace was demolished, construction started in 1592 using by the Florentine architect Giovanni Antonio Dosio, with help by Nencioni. Completed in 1619, the church was in a sober Florentine Renaissance style, with a Latin cross with three naves supported by arcuated colonnades and with lateral chapels. It was initially consecrated to the Birth of the Virgin of and All Saints (Ognisanti). There are two cloisters: the first cloister is called the ""chiostro maiolicato"" from its embedded maiolica tiles. A much larger second 17th-century cloister, is accessible through the first; this cloister hosts the entry to both the ""Quadreria"" or art collection, which had been previously housed in the sacristy of the Church, and the magnificent library of the Oratorian Fathers, the Biblioteca Girolamini, now run by the Italian state. The facade and other reconstructions were completed by Ferdinando Fuga in 1780. The facade statues of St Peter or St Paul were sculpted by Giuseppe Sammartino. The Church and the convent gallery contain works by major artists. The lavish gilt ceiling was badly damaged during aerial bombardment in February 1944, but has been partially restored. The church counterfacade has a Giordano painting of Jesus ejects the moneylenders from the Temple. The lateral doors have frescoes of Heliodorus and the Angel and Oza morto presso l’Arca by Filippo Mazzante. The first chapel on the right has an altarpiece depicting Saints Giorgio and Pantaleone by the Bolognese Gaetano Pandolfi; to the side are paintings of St Dominic and the Guardian Angel are by Francesco Fracanzano, pupil of Ribera; above is a painting of Saints Cosma and Damiano by Benasca. The 2nd chapel on the right has a small Madonna della Neve by a follower of Polidoro di Caravaggio, the paintings of God and Sts Anne and Joseph are by Giuseppe Marulli.

The main facade is asymmetrically fenestrated, but there are symmetrically placed gable dormers in the roof, and the entrance is in a slightly off-center gable-topped projection. The building corners, as well as those of the entry section, have Ionic stone pilasters at the corners. The main entrance is sheltered by a round portico supported by fluted Corinthian columns, which supported an entablature with a carved frieze. The portico is topped by a balcony with a low railing slightly different from that on the roof. Above the entrance is a French door flanked by stone fluted Corinthian pilasters, and topped by a scrollwork pediment. Large windows on either side of the entrance on the first floor are topped by similar pediments. Upon entry through the front door, there is a vestibule lit through stained-glass windows, followed by a panelled entry hall, which leads to a large two-story living space in the rear of the house, from which a grand staircase rises to the second floor. Pocket doors from these halls lead to what were formerly living and dining rooms at the front of the house, and there is a small guest bathroom immediately left of the vestibule in the front projection. A significant portion of the woodwork in the downstairs has been lost due to the building's conversion for municipal use, but the living room, which now serves as the selectmen's office, and the central hall are largely intact.

Archaeological discoveries suggest that people have been moving through the area for several thousands of years. The name Arvidsjaur itself comes from a Sami word which means ""generous water"" and was originally the name of the adjacent lake. In the 14th and 15th century some farmers settled in the area. They acquired furs and skins from the hunters, and traded them off to southern regions, allegedly in vast numbers. The Christianization of Arvidsjaur Municipality was slow, as it was in Norrland as a whole, because of the low population, the harsh climate and the long distances. It was also commonly believed that Norrland was inhabited by magicians. Not until 1577 did the first settler , Per Käck , settle in Arvidsjaur . The settlers built the first chapel at the marketplace at the time, in 1560. The first church was inaugurated in 1604. The Swedish minister and missionary Petrus Læstadius (1802–1841; brother of Lars Levi Læstadius, founder of the largest Christian revival movement in Norrland) collected old stories and myths in the area in the 19th century, which create the basis for our knowledge from that time.","Not until 1577 did the first settler, Per Käck, settle in Arvidsjaur.","Not until 1577 did the first settler, Per Käck, settle in Arvidsjaur.",,

Since its release, the film has received both strongly positive and strongly negative responses from critics. A.O. Scott of The New York Times wrote that the film was ""sly, daring, genuinely original and at times perversely brilliant"", while also stating that it was ""a singularly unpleasant movie"" that had ""scramble[d his] signals ... effectively, overriding deeply ingrained habits of response and judgment."" Eric Kohn of Indiewire praised the film, writing that it was ""a sheer delight of sarcasm and uneasy wit."" Writing in The Village Voice, Nick Pinkerton described The Color Wheel as ""a movie that's consistently unafraid to get confrontational and plain weird, with Colin's is-it-or-isn't-it-ironic racism, abrupt smothering close-ups, and scenes pushed past the boundaries of plausible motivation until they nosedive into absurdity.

David Edelstein of New York Magazine chose the film as a Critic's Pick, citing it as ""the most entertaining unpleasant film I’ve seen in years."" For a New York Times feature on the film, Cahiers du Cinéma editor Stéphane Delorme wrote that the film ""reminds us of a New York independent cinema that we loved — black and white, shot on film, spontaneous, with funny and intelligent dialogue — and that seemed to no longer exist."" Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe similarly praised the film, writing: ""There aren’t enough of these truly independent movies anymore."" A notable early champion of the film was critic Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, who was the first to write about The Color Wheel during its festival run. Vishnevetsky wrote that, ""despite (or maybe because of?) its detours into broad comedy, The Color Wheel manages to invest both characters with vulnerability, depth and even a perverse dignity; it's better at being a drama than most dramas."" Reviewing the film in Variety, Ronnie Scheib wrote: ""Hard to swallow but impossible to ignore, this nihilistic comedy may emerge as a cult touchstone."" Other critics were not as impressed. Peter Keough of The Boston Phoenix gave the film 1 1/2 out of 4 stars, comparing the film unfavorably to The Puffy Chair and writing that ""Alex Ross Perry's self-consciously coy indulgence reminds me of the work of Diablo Cody, but slighter and more irritating."" Shawn Levy of The Oregonian complained about the film's style, writing: ""There’s handmade and then there’s amateurish. This, alas, is the latter."" David Fear of Time Out New York gave the film a negative review, writing that ""Some will call The Color Wheel daring.

un,"Alimony [HEAD] History [SEP] The Code of Hammurabi (1754 BC) declares that a man must provide sustenance to a woman who has borne him children so that she can raise them: The above law applies only to women who had children with her husband. This fits more closely with the definition of child support in some jurisdictions. Alimony is also discussed in the Code of Justinian. The modern concept of alimony is derived from English ecclesiastical courts that awarded alimony in cases of separation and divorce. Alimony pendente lite was given until the divorce decree, based on the husband's duty to support the wife during a marriage that still continued. Post-divorce or permanent alimony was also based on the notion that the marriage continued, as ecclesiastical courts could only award a divorce a mensa et thoro, similar to a legal separation today. As divorce did not end the marriage, the husband's duty to support his wife remained intact. Liberalization of divorce laws occurred in the 19th century, but divorce was only possible in cases of marital misconduct. As a result, the requirement to pay alimony became linked to the concept of fault in the divorce. Alimony to wives was paid because it was assumed that the marriage, and the wife's right to support, would have continued but for the misbehavior of the husband. Ending alimony on divorce would have permitted a guilty husband to profit from his own misconduct. In contrast, if the wife committed the misconduct, she was considered to have forfeited any claim to ongoing support. However, during the period, parties could rarely afford alimony, and so it was rarely awarded by courts. As husbands' incomes increased, and with it the possibility of paying alimony, the awarding of alimony increased, generally because a wife could show a need for ongoing financial support, and the husband had the ability to pay. No-fault divorce led to changes in alimony. Whereas spousal support was considered a right under the fault-based system, it became conditional under the no-fault approach. According to the American Bar Association, marital fault is a ""factor"" in awarding alimony in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Permanent alimony began to fall out of favor , as it prevented former spouses from beginning new lives , though in some states ( e . g . , Massachusetts , Mississippi , and Tennessee ) , permanent alimony awards continued , but with some limitations . Alimony moved beyond support to permitting the more dependent spouse to become financially independent or to have the same standard of living as during the marriage or common law marriage, though this was not possible in most cases. In the 1970s, the United States Supreme Court ruled against gender bias in alimony awards and, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the percentage of alimony recipients who are male rose from 2.4% in 2001 to 3.6% in 2006. In states like Massachusetts and Louisiana, the salaries of new spouses may be used in determining the alimony paid to the previous partners. Most recently, in several high-profile divorces, women such as Britney Spears, Victoria Principal, and Jessica Simpson have paid multimillion-dollar settlements in lieu of alimony to ex-husbands. According to divorce lawyers, aggressive pursuit of spousal support by men is becoming more common, as the stigma associated with asking for alimony fades.","Permanent alimony began to fall out of favor, as it prevented former spouses from beginning new lives, though in some states (e.g., Massachusetts, Mississippi, and Tennessee), permanent alimony awards continued, but with some limitations.","Permanent alimony began to fall out of favor, as it prevented former spouses from beginning new lives, though in some states (e.g., Massachusetts, Mississippi, and Tennessee), permanent alimony awards continued, but with some limitations.",,

After meeting each other, the women were taken one at a time into a room where Gil Zamora asked the women to describe themselves from behind a curtain. The women were told to use neutral terms and stick to the facts in their descriptions. Zamora sketched each woman based only on her self-description. The next day the same woman was described by a stranger whom they had met in the loft. The two sketches were then shown to the subjects. The whole thing was recorded and the results were turned into a six-minute film entitled Dove Real Beauty Sketches. A shorter three-minute version was also released. In the films, each of the women describe themselves in a predominately negative way. For example, they use phrases such as ""rounder face,"" ""protruding jaw,"" and ""big forehead."" In contrast, the strangers use more positive language to describe the same person. In all cases the second sketch is more flattering, and more accurate, than the first. The dramatic differences in the sketches cause tears and other strong reactions when each woman is shown her two portraits.

The planet Medusa, home to a highly evolved and technologically advanced humanoid race, was already ruled by its women when a rogue comet knocked it out of its orbit of Proxima Centauri. Drifting through space, the orphan planet's surface became uninhabitable, and the inhabitants survived by building underground cities. The series begins with Medusa's entry into Earth's solar system. At first heartened to discover Earth, the Medusans are disappointed to learn that the human men are dominant there. Two Medusan men escape by stealing a ship and flying to Earth. Despite a successful escape, the two are pursued by the Medusan security forces. When the Medusans fail to re-capture the two men, they bring two human hostages—a man and a woman—back with them to their home planet. The series' 13 episodes concern the two groups' attempts to adapt to life on the different planets while brokering an exchange for the hostages. In the series finale, the Medusans' ship is pursued by another spacecraft, this one belonging to an alien race that has hunted Medusans in the past. Despite their technology and the antagonism they displayed throughout the series, the Medusans prove incapable of actually fighting an enemy, and only the intervention of a Medusan ship flown by an Earth man defeats the enemy. The saved Medusans return home, likely with an altered opinion of men. Regarded as something of a camp novelty, it does feature some female dominance elements. The series has some similarities with the British science-fiction series Space: 1999, whose second season was in pre production at Pinewood around the same time. Although Star Maidens was shot at Bray Studios by a different production company and did not benefit from as large a budget, both series featured the work of production designer Keith Wilson, whose props and set designs from Space: 1999 were adapted for Star Maidens, leading to a very similar look and feel. Even many of the sound effects from Space: 1999 were used. Lead actresses Judy Geeson and Lisa Harrow appeared in guest roles in the first season of Space: 1999, Geeson in the episode ""Another Time, Another Place"" and Harrow in ""The Testament of Arkadia"".

un,"Geology of the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex [HEAD] Depositional environment for the rocks of the DFW Metroplex [SEP] Transgression continued to occur after the deposition of the Woodbine, and created the Colorado Group which first created the Eagle Ford Shale which lies directly beneath west Dallas. The Eagle Ford Shale had sea level depths of around ≈100m or 330 ft, and occurred around 20–50 km from the shore. The depositional environment in the lower beds was low-energy and a slightly anoxic setting. This anoxic setting of the deeper waters in the ocean is a result several factors including increased global CO2 levels, higher sea levels, increased organic productivity and decay, Milankovitch cyclicity, and restricted thermohaline currents in the Western Interior Seaway. The lower section of the Eagle Ford consists of organic-rich, pyritic, and fossiliferous marine shale's which marks the maximum flooding surface, or peak of deepest water in its deposition. The different fauna that was present in the Eagle Ford suggests the waters were calm and within the photic zone. A small member of the Eagle Ford that consists of a thin limestone unit between shales is known as the Kamp Ranch. A small regressive highstand occurred to have formed this carbonate layer towards the top of the Eagle Ford, which is known due to the high energy traits it displays such as ripple marks from storm generated waves and interbedded carbonaceous siltstones. The overall thickness of the Eagle Ford Group undivided is around 200–300 feet thick. Sea level rose even higher in this massive transgressive event, which helped form the 300–500 ft thick Austin Chalk, around ≈89-85mya. The Austin formation consists of recrystallized, fossiliferous, interbedded chalks and marls. Exposures of Austin chalk are mainly seen in quarries, roadcuts, and stream beds where the water eroded the top soil. Austin chalk is the well known white rock that the city of Dallas sits on. Volcanic ashes are present in the Austin chalk, and were deposited by wind from distant erupting volcanoes and erupting igneous intrusions around 86 Ma. These eruptions occurred along a 250 mile long by 50 mile wide belt of submarine volcanoes, which are located in present-day south-central Texas. This belt of volcanoes coincides with the trend of the Balcones Fault zone and is known as the Balcones volcanic province . Of what consisted of these ancient volcanoes is only visible in a few places since most were buried by the Austin and Taylor Groups, and now are in the subsurface. The presence of this volcanism during deposition of the Austin Chalk is correlated with the Laramide orogeny. Sea level rose for conditions to be right for the deposition of the Austin Chalk, which also coincides with the maximum extent of the Cretaceous Interior Seaway. The depths of the deposition of the Austin Chalk occurred in ≈250m or 820 ft of water. The Austin Chalk formation is filled with micro-organisms known as coccoliths, and are a product of the warm waters that were displaced from the increased sea-floor spreading at the time.",This belt of volcanoes coincides with the trend of the Balcones Fault zone and is known as the Balcones volcanic province.,This belt of volcanoes coincides with the trend of the Balcones Fault zone and is known as the Balcones volcanic province.,,

In 2001 she was the Priesand Visiting Professor of Jewish Women’s Studies at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. Falk is a life member of the Art Students League of New York, where she studied painting as a child and adolescent. Her painting ""Gilead Apples"" was used as the cover illustration for her book The Days Between: Blessings, Poems, and Directions of the Heart for the Jewish High Holiday Season. She has also created a series of mizrachs featuring oil pastel paintings accompanied by texts from her volume of Hebrew and English prayers, The Book of Blessings. Falk’s poems have appeared in the American Poetry Review, Choice, Moment, Poet & Critic, Poetry Society of America Magazine, Her Face in the Mirror: Jewish Women on Mothers and Daughters (Beacon Press, 1994), September 11, 2001: American Writers Respond (Etruscan Press, 2002), Voices Within the Ark: The Modern Jewish Poets (Avon Books, 1980), Fire and Rain: Ecopoetry of California (Scarlet Tanager Books, 2018), and many other magazines and anthologies. She has published three collections of her own poems: My Son Likes Weather, This Year in Jerusalem, and It Is July in Virginia. Falk is also the author of The Spectacular Difference: Selected Poems of Zelda, a volume of translations of the Hebrew poetry of twentieth-century mystic Zelda Schneerson Mishkovsky, and ""With Teeth in the Earth: Selected Poems of Malka Heifetz Tussman."" The Song of Songs: Love Lyrics from the Bible, a classic verse translation of the biblical Song of Songs, was first published in 1977. The poet Adrienne Rich called her translation ""a beautiful and sensual poem in its own right."" 1996's The Book of Blessings: New Jewish Prayers for Daily Life, the Sabbath, and the New Moon Festival was acclaimed for its nongendered depictions of the divine, replacing traditional masculine terminology for God (i.e., Lord and King) with what Falk calls ""new images for divinity."" Writing in The Women's Review of Books, Judith Plaskow hailed the book's ""extraordinarily beautiful prayers,"" which use ""no female images and little feminine grammar. Instead , [ Marcia Falk ] evokes the sacred as totally immanent in creation , offering an alternative to the whole notion of God as male or female person . "" The Days Between: Blessings, Poems, and Directions of the Heart for the Jewish High Holiday Season, published in 2014, takes a similar approach to the High Holy Day season, recreating the holidays’ key prayers and rituals from an inclusive perspective. Rabbi David Teutsch of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College praised the author for demonstrating ""a poet’s gift for words that open inner vistas, a liturgist’s capacity to speak to the universal, a scholar’s insight into Jewish traditions and texts, and a contemporary feminist’s fresh vision."" She published Inner East: Illuminated Poems and Blessings in 2019. In Inner East, Falk’s poems and blessings are paired with her paintings, as they are in her mizrachs. Traditionally, in Jewish communities west of the Holy Land, mizrachs are hung on an eastern wall to indicate the direction to face during prayer. “Inner east” refers to a direction of the heart, a pointer toward the spiritual core within ourselves. Falk lives in Berkeley, California, with her husband, the poet Steven Jay Rood; they have one son, Abraham Gilead Falk-Rood.","Instead, [Falk] evokes the sacred as totally immanent in creation, offering an alternative to the whole notion of God as male or female person.""","Marcia Falk evokes the sacred as totally immanent in creation, offering an alternative to the whole notion of God as male or female person.""",,

The ends of the Y are equipped with rotating joints by which the smaller moving pieces are attached to the sculpture. Each moving piece is a triangular, tapering beam that is connected at a point approximately one fourth of its length away from the wider end of the beam. Small greased bearings keep the sculpture moving freely. Rickey relies on random wind currents to introduce movement into his sculptures, similarly to other kinetic artists such as Alexander Calder. In contrast to the biomorphic forms of Calder's mobiles, however, Rickey's linear, oscillating forms trace paths in space that reject organic motifs in favor of geometry.

un,"Sex toy [HEAD] In literature ; Early modern period [SEP] In the early 1590s, the English playwright Thomas Nashe wrote a poem known as The Choise of Valentines, Nashe's Dildo or The Merrie Ballad of Nashe his Dildo. This was not printed at the time, due to its obscenity but it was still widely circulated and made Nashe's name notorious. The poem describes a visit to a brothel by a man called ""Tomalin""; he is searching for his sweetheart, Francis, who has become a prostitute. The only way he can see her is to hire her. However, she resorts to using a glass dildo as he finds himself unable to perform sexually to her satisfaction. Dildos are humorously mentioned in Act IV, scene iv of Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale. This play and Ben Jonson's play The Alchemist (1610) are typically cited as the first use of the word in publication (Nashe's Merrie Ballad was not published until 1899). John Wilmot, the seventeenth-century English libertine, published his poem Signor Dildo in 1673. During the Parliamentary session of that year, objections were raised to the proposed marriage of James, Duke of York, brother of the King and heir to the throne, to Mary of Modena, an Italian Catholic princess. An address was presented to King Charles on 3 November, foreseeing the dangerous consequences of marriage to a Catholic, and urging him to put a stop to any planned wedding '...to the unspeakable Joy and Comfort of all Your loyal Subjects."" Wilmot's response was , a mock address anticipating the 'solid' advantages of a Catholic marriage, namely the wholesale importation of Italian dildos, to the unspeakable joy and comfort of all the ladies of England: This ballad was subsequently added to by other authors, and became so popular that Signor became a term for a dildo. In the epilogue to The Mistaken Husband (1674), by John Dryden, an actress complains: Signor Dildo was set to music by Michael Nyman for the 2004 biopic, The Libertine. Many other works of bawdy and satirical English literature of the period deal with the subject. Dildoides : A Burlesque Poem ( London , 1706 ) , attributed to Samuel Butler , is a mock lament to a collection of dildos that had been seized and publicly burnt by the authorities . Examples of anonymous works include The Bauble, a tale (London, 1721) and Monsieur Thing's Origin: or Seignor D---o's Adventures in London, (London, 1722). In 1746, Henry Fielding wrote The Female Husband: or the surprising history of Mrs Mary, alias Mr. George Hamilton, in which a woman posing as a man uses a dildo. This was a fictionalized account of the story of Mary Hamilton. Dildos are obliquely referred to in Saul Bellow's novel The Adventures of Augie March (1953): ""....he had brought me along to a bachelor's stag where two naked acrobatic girls did stunts with false tools"". A dildo called Steely Dan III from Yokohama appears in the William S. Burroughs novel The Naked Lunch (1959). The rock band Steely Dan took their name from it.","Dildoides: A Burlesque Poem (London, 1706), attributed to Samuel Butler, is a mock lament to a collection of dildos that had been seized and publicly burnt by the authorities.","Dildoides: A Burlesque Poem (London, 1706), attributed to Samuel Butler, is a mock lament to a collection of dildos that had been seized and publicly burnt by the authorities.",,
un,"William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham [HEAD] Pitt–Newcastle ministry ; Annus Mirabilis [SEP] In France a new leader, the Duc de Choiseul, had recently come to power and 1759 offered a duel between their rival strategies. Pitt intended to continue with his plan of tying down French forces in Germany while continuing the assault on France's colonies. Choiseul hoped to repel the attacks in the colonies while seeking total victory in Europe. Pitt's war around the world was largely successful. While a British invasion of Martinique failed, they captured Guadeloupe shortly afterwards. In India , a French attempt to capture Madras was repulsed . In North America, British troops closed in on France's Canadian heartland. A British force under James Wolfe moved up the Saint Lawrence with the aim of capturing Quebec. After initially failing to penetrate the French defences at the Montmorency Falls, Wolfe later led his men to a victory to the west of the city allowing the British forces to capture Quebec. Choiseul had pinned much of his hopes on a French invasion of Britain, which he hoped would knock Britain out of the war and make it surrender the colonies it had taken from France. Pitt had stripped the home islands of troops to send on his expeditions, leaving Britain guarded by poorly trained militia and giving an opportunity for the French if they could land in enough force. The French did build a large invasion force. However the French naval defeats at Lagos and Quiberon Bay forced Choiseul to abandon the invasion plans. France's other great hope, that their armies could make a breakthrough in Germany and invade Hanover, was thwarted at the Battle of Minden. Britain ended the year victorious in every theatre of operations in which it was engaged, with Pitt receiving the credit for this.","In India, a French attempt to capture Madras was repulsed.","In India, a French attempt to capture Madras was repulsed.",,

done,"Sidney Hillman [HEAD] Legacy [SEP] According to labor historian David Brody, Hillman built upon the conservative job-oriented unionism that dominated the American scene, discarding his youthful radicalism and opposition to capitalism. Hillman was realistic, nonideological, and eager for tangible results. Under Hillman's leadership, the Amalgamated became an active partner in the men's clothing business, building two banks, fostering low-cost unemployment insurance, and setting up internal educational and social support programs for union members. This was the ""New Unionism""of the 1920s, which combined a large powerful union, with many small capitalist enterprises, all of them controlled by Jews who could talk together easily. Hillman's broader perspective gave him a leading role in forming the CIO and establishing entirely new mass-production unions that confronted not small local Jewish capitalists but world-class corporations. Hillman also was a pioneer in integrating union power with major political powers on a national level. The New Deal had proven a bonanza for union membership growth, and beginning with the 1936 presidential election, Hillman pushed hard for labor to give systematic nationwide support to Roosevelt and the New Deal cause. His main rival was John L. Lewis, who broke with Roosevelt, and with the CIO, leaving Hillman the central labor politician in the national Democratic Party. Hillman's successor as head of the ACWA, Jacob Potofsky, took a far less visible role within the CIO, a federation which re-united with the AFL in 1955. The American Labor Party that Hillman had helped create passed out of existence in that same year. The Amalgamated Housing Cooperative in the Bronx was the first limited equity housing cooperative in the United States. It was funded and inspired by Hillman and Abraham Kazan. A street in the neighborhood, Hillman Avenue, is named for him.

A very small number of Armenians, only around 5 per cent, worked as unskilled laborers; even fewer were landowners or farmers.

un,"Etruscan civilization [HEAD] Culture ; Religion [SEP] The Etruscan system of belief was an immanent polytheism; that is, all visible phenomena were considered to be a manifestation of divine power and that power was subdivided into deities that acted continually on the world of man and could be dissuaded or persuaded in favour of human affairs. How to understand the will of deities, and how to behave, had been revealed to the Etruscans by two initiators, Tages, a childlike figure born from tilled land and immediately gifted with prescience, and Vegoia, a female figure. Their teachings were kept in a series of sacred books. Three layers of deities are evident in the extensive Etruscan art motifs. One appears to be divinities of an indigenous nature: Catha and Usil, the sun; Tivr, the moon; Selvans, a civil god; Turan, the goddess of love; Laran, the god of war; Leinth, the goddess of death; Maris; Thalna; Turms; and the ever-popular Fufluns, whose name is related in some way to the city of Populonia and the populus Romanus, possibly, the god of the people. Ruling over this pantheon of lesser deities were higher ones that seem to reflect the Indo-European system: Tin or Tinia, the sky, Uni his wife (Juno), and Cel, the earth goddess.

done,"William D. Boyce [HEAD] Scouting ; Lone Scouts of America [SEP] Boyce clashed with James E. West, the BSA's Chief Scout Executive, over a program for boys who lived too far from town to join a troop. Boyce offered to publish a magazine for the BSA, as long as it was published in Chicago. The National Executive Board of the BSA turned this offer down and shortly thereafter Boyce ceased being active in administrative activities of the BSA, though he remained a staunch supporter of the program. As a result of this and his desire to serve boys who had limited opportunities as he himself did when he was young, Boyce started a new Scouting-related venture: the Lone Scouts of America (LSA) on January 9, 1915. Reliance on Native American themes gave LSA a distinct Native American flavor: Lone Scouts could form small groups known as ""tribes"", the tribe's treasurer was known as the ""wampum-bearer"", and LSA taught boys to respect the environment. Boyce's annual contribution to the LSA grew to $100,000. In both the BSA and the LSA, Boyce was a manager and had little direct contact with the Boy Scouts. Upon his return from reporting on World War I, Boyce immediately began expanding the LSA by starting Lone Scout magazine and hiring Frank Allan Morgan, a noted Chicago Scoutmaster, to lead the LSA. By November 1915, the LSA had over 30,000 members. Warren conferred upon Boyce the title Chief Totem. Youths could join the LSA simply by mailing in some coupons and five cents. By 1916, the BSA and the LSA were in direct competition for members. In the summer of 1917, during his annual Dakota hunt, the Gros Ventres Indian tribe made Boyce an honorary chief with the name ""Big Cloud"" during a three-day ceremony. With America at war, Boyce agreed to the creation of a Lone Scout uniform in late 1917. Though he had a uniform made for himself, he stipulated that no Lone Scout was required to purchase one. Boyce felt that Lone Scout was the best magazine he had ever done. Lone Scout was so popular that it could not handle all the material that was submitted, so many local and regional Tribe Papers were started. By 1922, Boyce's newspaper business was suffering and Lone Scout was losing money—it switched from a weekly to a monthly. Boyce's racial prejudice was revealed when the racial tensions in Chicago increased in the 1920s. The LSA issued a formal proclamation in late 1920 that it would only accept whites and in 1922 changed the masthead of Lone Scout from ""A Real Boys' Magazine"" to ""The White Boys Magazine"".

Madison discovered that the LSA Lone Scouts of America ' s membership roster was wildly inaccurate : it was full of duplications and inactive members .

Some Lone Scouts did not transfer to the BSA, but the BSA continued Lone Scouting as a separate division for another decade, gradually losing its unique programs. Present day Lone Scouts use the standard Cub Scouting and Boy Scouting programs and activities, but are not part of a pack or troop on a regular basis because of factors such as distance, weather, time, disability or other difficulties.",Madison discovered that the LSA's membership roster was wildly inaccurate: it was full of duplications and inactive members.,George N.

It is unclear what actions Gilbreath took or performed during this skirmish, however Gilbreath reports that against an estimated 300 enemy troops, the regiment took only 3 casualties. Gilbreath saw heavier fighting on June 25, with the commencement of the Battle of Oak Grove. The only tactical advance during McClellan's peninsular campaign, a Union attack on Confederate positions began at approximately 8 a.m. on the 25th, with the 20th Indiana situated on the extreme left of the advancing Union picket line. Gilbreath reports that General Joe Hooker's Division, which formed the right side of the assault, met with heavy resistance, but still managed to accomplish his objectives by pushing the Confederates back through three picket lines. General Heintzelman ordered artillery support for Hooker's division, which put an end to immediate Confederate resistance in that area. The pressure at that point shifted towards the left flank of the Union advance, which contained the 20th Indiana. Gilbreath reported that a sudden Confederate attack came at 5:30 p.m., as the 20th Indiana was preparing to charge across an open field. The attack was focused on the 87th New York Volunteer Regiment, which was on the 20th Indiana's right flank. The 87th New York broke, leaving the right flank of the 20th Indiana exposed to the Confederate assault. Gilbreath reports that after heavy fighting, he was driven back with his regiment a short distance. The regiment was then rallied, and retook their previously held positions and held off three more Confederate assaults. Gilbreath reports that the regiment lost 125 men, comprising almost a fifth of the casualties incurred by the entire 3rd Corps during the day's fighting. During the battle Captain Lytle, commander of I Company, was mortally wounded. The day after the battle of Oak Grove, the right flank of the Army, located north of the Chikahominy River, was attacked by forces from General Daniel Harvey Hill. The right flank, made up of 5th Corps under command of General Fitz-John Porter, broke during an attack on the 27th of June due to lack of support and retreated across the Chikahominy towards the main battle force on the southern side of the Chikahominy. It was at this point that McClellan believed it best to retreat back to the James River.","Gilbreath's first land battle occurred on June 19, when a small Confederate force attacked the picket line of the 20th Indiana at 4:30 a.m.","Erasmus Corwin Gilbreath's first land battle during the American Civil War occurred on June 19, when a small Confederate force attacked the picket line of the 20th Indiana at 4:30 a.m.",,

During the 1984 season, he had completed 156 of 253 passes for 1,963 yards, falling just short of his predecessor Alan Cockrell's single-season record of 2,021 yards (set in 1983). His 61.7% completion percentage had broken the single-season record set by Johnny Majors in 1956. Fifth-year senior Daryl Dickey, Robinson's backup, would start the final seven games after Robinson suffered a season-ending knee injury. Three redshirt freshmen were competing for the third-string quarterback slot: Jeff Francis, Randy Sanders, and Greg Hargis. All-American prospect Tim McGee was the leading returning wide receiver, having caught a school record 54 passes in 1984. McGee entered the 1985 season needing 45 catches, 828 yards, and 5 touchdowns to set school career records in all three categories, a feat which he would accomplish. Tim McGee was joined in the starting lineup of the 1985 Tennessee Volunteers football team by junior college transfer Eric Swanson ( 20 catches for 186 yards in 1984 ) , while junior Joey Clinkscales and sophomore Vince Carter would see significant playing time . Olympic sprinter Sam Graddy joined the team as a receiver during spring practice. Senior Jeff Smith (6'3"", 235 pounds), who had caught 26 passes for 416 yards in 1984, was the team's starting tight end, while Tim Hendrix (6'5"", 223) would see significant playing time. The running back slot was wide open following the graduation of 2nd-team All American Johnnie Jones. Sophomore Charles Wilson began the season as the starter, and was joined by redshirt freshman Keith Davis and junior Pete Panuska. One notable addition to the running back corps was Jeff Powell, a member of the track team who had been awarded the football team's final scholarship at the end of spring practice. Fullback duties were handled by 250-pound junior Sam Henderson, 225-pound sophomore William Howard and 230-pound junior Jim Miller. The offensive line had lost Raleigh McKenzie and Bill Mayo to graduation, but returned future NFL players David Douglas (6'4"", 266 pounds), Bruce Wilkerson (6'5"", 258), Daryle Smith (6'5"", 257), John Bruhin (6'4"", 273), and Harry Galbreath (6'1"", 260). Todd Kirk (6'3"", 257) was the starting center. Tony Williams (6'3"", 272) would also see playing time. On defense, the Vols had lost three linebackers to the NFL Draft: Carl Zander, Alvin Toles, and Reggie McKenzie. The key returning linebacker was Dale Jones, who had registered 109 tackles in 1984, and had garnered a reputation for making big plays. Jones was joined by senior Lavoisier Fisher, junior Tyrone Robinson, sophomores Kelly Ziegler and Darrin Miller, and freshman Bryan Kimbro. The defensive line was led by senior Richard Brown (6'1"", 263 pounds) and junior Robby Scott (6'1"", 274), while sophomores Mark Hovanic (6'3"", 245), Fred Bennett (6'0"", 258) and Richard Cooper (6'6"", 272) had shown promise as freshmen. The Vols' secondary was considered the strongest part of the defense at the beginning of the season, with Tommy Sims and Terry Brown registering strong seasons in 1984. They were joined by junior Charles Davis and sophomores Terry McDaniel, Andre Creamer and Victor Peppers.

done,"Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein [HEAD] Biography [SEP] In 1742 Kratzenstein started to study physics and medicine at the university in Halle which at that time had a leading position in that region. His interests turned now to the investigations of electricity and in particular the effects on living organisms. After four years he received in 1746 doctoral degrees in physics and in medicine. He was then only 23 years old. After two years as a privatdozent he was in 1748 elected to the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in the same city. At that time Kratzenstein had achieved international recognition and was in 1748 called to the science academy in Saint Petersburg. It is likely that Leonhard Euler, who had worked there earlier before he took up a new position at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, had used his influence in this connection. He had corresponded with Kratzenstein over a period of several years. In his new position Kratzenstein worked among other projects on improving instruments for navigation on the open seas. These were tried out in 1753 on a ship expedition from Arkhangelsk along the Norwegian coast through Kattegat and the Baltic Sea back to Saint Petersburg. During the voyage he had made a stop-over in Copenhagen and received a short time later an offer from the university there. In the fall of 1753 he was appointed professor of experimental physics and medicine. At the same time he was elected to the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters. He would remain in that city until his death. Kratzenstein became known in a short time as an engaging lecturer and attracted a large audience of both regular students and interested persons from the citizenry. He covered topics ranging from the newest insights about plants and animals, through geology, physiology to physics and chemistry. At that time there were often rather diffuse separations between these disciplines. When he died, he had saved 12000 riksdaler which were bestowed to the university. A few years later this fund enabled Hans Christian Ørsted to build up his own laboratory for physical experiments. His work at the university strengthened the academic standards and manifested itself in many ways. Thus it was Kratzenstein who seized the initiative before the important transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769 instead of the astronomers at the Rundetårn observatory. In order to spread the impact of his lectures he wrote a textbook in experimental physics. It was published in several editions and appeared in German, French and Latin in addition to the Danish version. As a result of all his efforts and engagements he served as rector at the university during four periods. During his time in Copenhagen he maintained contacts with his former colleagues in Saint Petersburg. The science academy there announced in 1778 a prize competition concerning the mechanisms behind the vowels A, E, I, O and U in human speech. Euler had previously been interested in this problem and it is likely that he was behind the formulation of the task. Kratzenstein won the first prize in 1780 by constructing a «vowel organ» which could produce these special sounds. This represents one of the first contributions to modern speech synthesis. By his wide range of engagements and temperament Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein would often end up in conflicts with his colleagues . In later years he suffered in addition from illnesses which could have been caused by his chemical experiments. After his wife Anna Margrethe Hagen, with whom he had four children, died in 1783, he actively sought a new wife and married the year after Anna Maria Thuun from Hamburg. At the big fire in Copenhagen 1795 he lost most of his possessions and scientific equipment. He moved out to the suburb Frederiksberg where he died a month later.",By his wide range of engagements and temperament Kratzenstein would often end up in conflicts with his colleagues.,By his wide range of engagements and temperament Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein would often end up in conflicts with his colleagues.,,

Unlike most of its occupants, however, she is not in torment, and still senses hope reaching her from outside of Hell—a fact that disturbs the Lords of Hell greatly. During her audience with them, they trick her into using her empathy, which forces her to assume a hideous and misshapen form and trap her in it. The lords, having ""judged"" her, quickly exile her into another portion of Hell. However, an angry Meggan lashes out with her empathy, which causes all other lesser demons in her presence to rally behind her, having been affected by her anger. This catches the attention of Pluto, the Greek God of the Underworld (and old enemy of Hercules). They forge an alliance and he restores Meggan to her usual self. She spends the following months leading her army of demon followers in waging a war against the Lords of Hell, very successfully since her empathy overwhelms the enemy armies, causing them to turn on their respective lords (most noticeably Blackheart). During one such battle, she feels nostalgic and reminisces about her husband Brian. This causes her army to feel happiness, something that they haven't experienced in a while—if at all. The demons name her Gloriana in honor of this feat, and idolize her further.

un,"Kisii people [HEAD] Origins of Agricultural Practices in Gusiiland [SEP] The agricultural practices of the Abagusii originate from the Neolithic Agropastoralist inhabitants of present-day Gusiiland and much of Luo-Nyanza and the former Rift Valley provinces as well as the rest of Kenya. The original crops grown in Gusiiland were mainly cereals such as millet, sorghum and barley as well as pumpkin all which originate from the ancient Agropastoralist ancestors of the modern Abagusii as well as the Kuria, and the Luo of Kenya and Northern Tanzania. Most of the other crops grown today in Gusiiland such as tea, coffee, bananas/plantains and several others have been grown in Gusiiland since the 19th century after their introduction by the British. For instance , by 1920s maize had been introduced to Gusiiland and had overtaken finger millet and sorghum as staple crops and cash crops which ensured that maize became the new dominant staple crop . Coffee and tea as well as several other exotic crops grown in Gusiiland today were introduced during the same time period as maize. Most of the crops originating outside Africa such as bananas/plantains, maize, tea, coffee, rice and several other crops were originally introduced to the African coastlines especially the eastern coastline by the Arabs, Portuguese, Indian and southeast Asian traders as well as the western and southern coastlines of Africa through the Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish traders. These crops were later introduced to the interior of Africa during the 19 century by the European colonists who cultivated these crops in various African countries that they colonized. These crops were later inherited by the indigenous African peoples in post-colonial Africa that learnt the cultivation of these foreign crops from the European colonists through labor on white farms. It is important noting that the Abagusii were mainly pastoralists and hunters/gatherers during the pre-colonial Kenya and practised cereal and pumpkin farming to a lesser extent.","For instance, by 1920s maize had been introduced to Gusiiland and had overtaken finger millet and sorghum as staple crops and cash crops which ensured that maize became the new dominant staple crop.","For instance, by 1920s maize had been introduced to Gusiiland and had overtaken finger millet and sorghum as staple crops and cash crops which ensured that maize became the new dominant staple crop.",,

done,"Avar–Byzantine wars [HEAD] Avar invasion (597–602) [SEP] Emboldened by the plunder from the Franks, the Avars resumed their raids across the Danube in autumn of 597, catching the Byzantines by surprise. The Avars even caught Priscus' army while it was still in its camp in Tomis, and laid siege to it. However, they lifted the siege on 30 March 598, at the approach of a Byzantine army led by Comentiolus, which had just crossed Mount Haemus and was marching along the Danube up to Zikidiba, only 30 kilometres (19 mi) from Tomis. For unknown reasons, Priscus did not join Comentiolus when he pursued the Avars. Comentiolus made camp at Iatrus, however he was routed by the Avars, and his troops had to fight their way back over the Haemus. The Avars took advantage of this victory and advanced to Drizipera, near Constantinople. At Drizipera the Avar forces were struck by a plague, leading to the death of a large portion of their army, and seven sons of Bayan, the Avar Khagan. Due to the threat posed by the Avar forces at Drizipera, Comentiolus was replaced with Philippicus, and recalled to Constantinople. Maurice assembled a force made up of the Circus Factions and his bodyguards to defend the Anastasian Wall. Maurice then paid off the Avars for a temporary truce, spending the rest of 598 in reorganizing his forces and analyzing how to improve the Byzantines' strategy. In the same year, the Byzantines concluded a peace treaty with the Avars, which allowed the Byzantines to send expeditions into Wallachia. Ignoring the peace treaty, the Byzantines made preparations to invade the Avars' land. Priscus set up expeditionary camp near Singidunum and wintered there in 598/599. In 599 Priscus and Comentiolus led their troops downstream to Viminacium, and crossed the Danube. Once on the north bank, they defeated the Avars in the Battles of Viminacium. This battle was significant, as it was the first time the Avars suffered a major defeat in their home territory, and also led to the deaths of several more of Bayan's sons. After the battle, Priscus led his forces north into the Pannonian plain, engaging and defeating the Avars deep within their heartland. Comentiolus meanwhile remained near the Danube, to guard it. Priscus devastated the lands east of the Tisza, inflicting heavy casualties on the Avars and Gepids, and defeating them in two further battles on the banks of the Tisza. In autumn 599, Comentiolus reopened the Gates of Trajan, which had not been used by the Byzantines for decades. In 601 Peter the Great led troops to the banks of the Tisza , to defend the Danube cataracts , which were vital to the Byzantine Danube fleet ' s access to the cities of Sirmium and Singidunum .

done,"Type 7 30 cm howitzer [HEAD] Design [SEP] The Type 7 was conventional for its time and other nations had similar weapons such as the Italian Obice da 305/17, Russian 11-inch mortar M1877, and the 12-inch coast defense mortar from the United States. The theory of operation for the Type 7 was that a low-velocity howitzer firing a large shell at a high-angle was more likely to destroy an enemy ship by penetrating its thin deck armor than a high-velocity low-angle gun attempting to penetrate its thicker belt armor. The downside was that high-angle fire was harder to aim correctly so more howitzers would be needed to defend an area from attack. However, if the area was constrained by geography like a port at the mouth of a river the navigation channels could be measured ahead of time and firing ranges calculated. A complicating factor was as naval artillery progressed their size and range soon eclipsed its range. The Type 7 howitzer was introduced to supplement the Armstrong-designed 28 cm L/10 howitzer as coastal artillery with a secondary siege artillery role. Although it had a caliber of 305 mm (12 in), it was referred to as a 30 cm howitzer. The Type 7s were typical built-up guns of the period, with rifled steel inner tubes and layers of external reinforcing hoops. The guns had interrupted screw breeches and fired separate loading cased charges and projectiles. Firing The Type 7 30 cm howitzer was fired by percussion cap and hammer tripped by a long lanyard . There were two variants of the Type 7 produced, one with a short, L/16 caliber, barrel, and one with a long, L/23 caliber, barrel. The long barreled version weighed nearly twice as much as the short barreled version. The Type 7s were mounted on garrison mounts which consisted of large rectangular steel platforms approximately 5.72 m (18 ft 9 in) long, and 1.42 m (4 ft 8 in) wide, set on top of large circular geared steel rings set in concrete. This mount allowed 360° of traverse and +2° to +73° of elevation. The recoil system for the Type 7 consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with a hydro-gravity recoil system above the breech. When the gun fired, the hydraulic buffers slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned the gun to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. Two equilibrators were mounted below the barrel and two compressed air-tanks were mounted on the carriage for blowing out the tube after firing.",Firing was by percussion cap and hammer tripped by a long lanyard.,The Type 7 30 cm howitzer was fired by percussion cap and hammer tripped by a long lanyard.,,

According to Andrew Tuck, the Western study of Nagarjuna's madhyamaka can be divided into three phases: The Sri Lankan philosopher David Kalupahana meanwhile saw madhyamaka as a response to certain essentialist philosophical tendencies which had arisen after the time of the Buddha and sees it as a restoration of the early Buddhist middle way pragmatist position. Among the critical voices, Richard P. Hayes (influenced by Richard Robinson's view that Nagarjuna's logic fails modern tests for validity) interprets the works of Nagarjuna as ""primitive"" and guilty ""errors in reasoning"" such as that of equivocation. Hayes states that Nagarjuna was relying on the different meanings of the word svabhava to make statements which were not logical and that his work relies on various ""fallacies and tricks"". William Magee strongly disagrees with Richard P . Hayes , referring to Tsonghkhapa ' s interpretation of Nagarjuna to argue that Hayes misidentifies Nagarjuna ' s understanding of the different meanings of the term svabhava . Many recent western scholars (such as Garfield, Napper, Hopkins,) have tended to adopt a Gelug Prāsaṅgika influenced interpretation of madhyamaka. However, American philosopher Mark Siderits is one exception, who has attempted to defend the Svātantrika position as a coherent and rational interpretation of madhyamaka. C.W. Huntington meanwhile has been particularly critical of the modern Western attempt to read Nagarjuna ""through the lens of modern symbolic logic"" and to see him as compatible with analytical philosophy's logical system. He argues that in reading Nagarjuna, a thinker who he sees as ""profoundly distrustful of logic"", in an overly logical manner, we ""prejudice our understanding of Nagarjuna's insistence that he has no proposition (pratijña)."" He puts forth a more literary interpretation that focuses on the effect Nagarjuna was attempting to ""conjure"" on his readers (i.e. an experience of having no views) instead of asking how it works (or doesn't) in a logical manner. In response to this, Jay Garfield defends the logical reading of Nagarjuna through the use of Anglo-American analytical philosophy as well as arguing that ""Nagarjuna and Candrakirti deploy arguments, take themselves to do so, and even if they did not, we would be wise to do so in commenting on their texts"". Another recent interpreter, Jan Westerhoff, argues that madhyamaka is a kind of anti-foundationalism, ""which does not just deny the objective, intrinsic, and mind-independent existence of some class of objects, but rejects such existence for any kinds of objects that we could regard as the most fundamental building-blocks of the world.""","William Magee strongly disagrees with Hayes, referring to Tsonghkhapa's interpretation of Nagarjuna to argue that Hayes misidentifies Nagarjuna's understanding of the different meanings of the term svabhava.","William Magee strongly disagrees with Richard P.

done,"Mongolian script [HEAD] History [SEP] The Mongolian vertical script developed as an adaptation of the Old Uyghur alphabet for the Mongolian language. From the seventh and eighth to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the Mongolian language separated into southern, eastern and western dialects. The principal documents from the period of the Middle Mongol language are: in the eastern dialect, the famous text The Secret History of the Mongols, monuments in the Square script, materials of the Chinese–Mongolian glossary of the fourteenth century, and materials of the Mongolian language of the middle period in Chinese transcription, etc. ; in the western dialect, materials of the Arab–Mongolian and Persian–Mongolian dictionaries, Mongolian texts in Arabic transcription, etc. The main features of the period of the Middle Mongolian language are that the vowels ï and i had lost their phonemic significance , creating the i phoneme ( in the Chakhar dialect , the Standard Mongolian in Inner Mongolia , these vowels are still distinct ) ; inter - vocal consonants γ / g , b / w had disappeared and the preliminary process of the formation of Mongolian long vowels had begun ; the initial h was preserved in many words ; grammatical categories were partially absent , etc . The development over this period explains why the Mongolian script looks like a vertical Arabic script (in particular the presence of the dot system). Eventually, minor concessions were made to the differences between the Uyghur and Mongol languages: In the 17th and 18th centuries, smoother and more angular versions of the letter tsadi became associated with [dʒ] and [tʃ] respectively, and in the 19th century, the Manchu hooked yodh was adopted for initial [j]. Zain was dropped as it was redundant for [s]. Various schools of orthography, some using diacritics, were developed to avoid ambiguity. Traditional Mongolian is written vertically from top to bottom, flowing in lines from left to right. The Old Uyghur script and its descendants, of which traditional Mongolian is one among Oirat Clear, Manchu, and Buryat are the only known vertical scripts written from left to right. This developed because the Uyghurs rotated their Sogdian-derived script, originally written right to left, 90 degrees counterclockwise to emulate Chinese writing, but without changing the relative orientation of the letters. The reed pen was the writing instrument of choice until the 18th century, when the brush took its place under Chinese influence. Pens were also historically made of wood, reed, bamboo, bone, bronze, or iron. Ink used was black or cinnabar red, and written with on birch bark, paper, cloths made of silk or cotton, and wooden or silver plates. Writing implements of the Bogd Khan Mongols learned their script as a syllabary, dividing the syllables into twelve different classes, based on the final phonemes of the syllables, all of which ended in vowels. The script remained in continuous use by Mongolian speakers in Inner Mongolia in People's Republic of China. In the Mongolian People's Republic, it was largely replaced by the Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet, although the vertical script remained in limited use. In March 2020, the Mongolian government announced plans to increase the use of the traditional Mongolian script and to use both Cyrillic and Mongolian script in official documents by 2025.","The main features of the period are that the vowels ï and i had lost their phonemic significance, creating the i phoneme (in the Chakhar dialect, the Standard Mongolian in Inner Mongolia, these vowels are still distinct); inter-vocal consonants γ/g, b/w had disappeared and the preliminary process of the formation of Mongolian long vowels had begun; the initial h was preserved in many words; grammatical categories were partially absent, etc.","The main features of the period of the Middle Mongolian language are that the vowels ï and i had lost their phonemic significance, creating the i phoneme (in the Chakhar dialect, the Standard Mongolian in Inner Mongolia, these vowels are still distinct); inter-vocal consonants γ/g, b/w had disappeared and the preliminary process of the formation of Mongolian long vowels had begun; the initial h was preserved in many words; grammatical categories were partially absent, etc.",,

Now known as George Temple, he becomes a mild-mannered teetotalling shopkeeper, little respected by the other townsfolk. One day comes news that outlaw Vinnie Harold (Crawford) has gunned down Clint Fallon (Walter Coy), reputedly the ""fastest draw in the west."" George listens to the townsmen talk about Wyatt Earp, Wes Hardin, and other so-called ""fast guns"". They are also laughing at George, seeing him as nothing but a ""ribbon clerk"". His pride stung, George retrieves a gun from hiding (he told his wife he had tossed it into a river years ago) and—over her desperate pleading not to destroy the peaceful life they have built—says ""they have to know who I am."" The men are astonished at seeing George wearing a gun, believing him to be drunk. He sets about destroying the myths these men have about gunmen, displaying a detailed knowledge of guns and gunmen they never suspected he had. George then blurts out his secret that he is the fastest gun alive, ""... faster than Earp, faster than Hardin, faster than Fallon, and faster than the man who killed him."" With the citizens understandably skeptical, George takes them into the street and gives them a demonstration of his skill. First, with only two shots, he hits two silver dollars tossed into the air on the count of three. Following that, he shoots a beer glass full of beer dropped from Harvey Maxwell's (Allyn Joslyn) hand at 20 feet, hitting it almost immediately after it leaves the man's hand. Later , while everyone is in church , where they have taken an oath not to tell George ' s secret , Harold rides into town . A local boy tells him about George's display of gun skill. Though he is on the run—and over the objections of his fellow bank robbers, Taylor Swope (John Dehner) and Dink Wells (Noah Beery Jr.), who just want to escape the law—Harold is intent to remain in town until he can see this George Temple face-to-face. Harold finds out that the ""fast gun"" is in the church. He sends Swope there to call him out. When the townspeople refuse to send out ""the man who shot two silver dollars at the same time"", Harold gives an order to Dink to find some kerosene and pour it everywhere. He then instructs Swope to deliver a message to the people in the church that if their fast gun does not come out in five minutes, Vinnie and his men will burn down the whole town. The townspeople now try to force George into the street. George must reveal the whole truth, explaining that he is no gunman, that he has never been in a real gunfight. The gun with the notches in the handle actually belonged to his father George Kelby (a famous lawman shot down in an ambush) and he is terrified at the prospect of actually facing a man in a gunfight. Swope and Wells elect to abandon Vinnie. Dink stays for a while, but he also rides off. Swope, who decides to take his share of the gang's loot, is told by Vinnie to either draw or ride out, but without any of the loot. Swope toys with the idea of drawing on Vinnie, but thinks better of it and leaves.","Later, while everyone is in church, where they have taken an oath not to tell George's secret, Harold rides into town.","Later, while everyone is in church, where they have taken an oath not to tell George's secret, Harold rides into town.",,

done,"Trams in Bern [HEAD] History ; Interwar period [SEP] Between 1921 and 1932, the summer tramcars were rebuilt in the SSB's own workshop into closed all-year-round trailers. Some vehicles were used as testbeds for various modifications until, with one exception, they were all fitted with the large round platforms that were typical for Bern. In 1923, the network was extended once again for the first time in 15 years. With the commissioning of the branch line from the Effingerstrasse into Fischermätteli on 18 November 1923, the Bern tramway network reached a length of 18.2 km (11.3 mi). The branch line was the last new SSB line to be built for nearly a quarter of a century. The new line's introduction led to a slight change in the network's operations: trams now ran from Brückfeld into Fischermätteli (line 11; in the opposite direction, line 12). The line to Wabern became a radial route. An application by the Bern–Worb-Bahn for permission to relocate its terminus from Helvetiaplatz to Casinoplatz (Hotelgasse) at the other (Bern) end of the Kirchenfeld Bridge was met with a negative response from the City of Bern: it feared that such a relocation would lead to a substantial deterioration of the traffic conditions on the edge of the inner city. Instead, the proposal started a political debate that extended over the following eight decades, until it was finally implemented in the late 1990s. From 1924, trams made up of three tramcars were operated during rush hours for reasons of cost. In subsequent years, the SSB continued to incur no significant outgoings. Apart from the two extensions to Brückfeld and Wankdorf stadium, which operated only on special occasions, the main work the company performed on its tracks was maintenance work. As a search for cheap second hand tramcars in Germany, where the hyperinflation of 1923 had driven a number of tram operators into bankruptcy, did not produce the desired result, the company had to keep the 1901/02 vintage two axle motor tramcars in service by replacing the car bodies that had become rotten. Additionally, the Maximum motor tramcars were fitted with more powerful engines; the SSB thus hoped to extend their service life by 15 to 20 years. However, it was not possible to install track brakes in these cars, which is why they continued to operate mostly on line 3/4. From 1928, pantographs replaced the bow collectors with which the SSB tramcars had previously been fitted. Major renovation work carried out in 1930 in the Bahnhofplatz/Bubenbergplatz area changed not only the image of that part of the city, but also the line routes of the SSB. On the Bubenbergplatz, a large stabling area for trams (the ""Blasermätteli"") came into being. The station was robbed of its large entrance hall, and its front was moved to the back. The SSB took the opportunity to reorganise the network and introduced the coloured route panels still used in part today: In August of the same year, the SSB received its first new vehicles for 16 years. These were two four-axle motor tramcars of type Be 4/4. In 1931, the SSB applied for a concession to extend line 5/6 by 800 m (2,600 ft) along the Muristrasse to Egghölzli. The cantonal authorities rejected this application, on the grounds that it could not accept responsibility for a double track section in the Muristrasse, with its heavy motor vehicle traffic. In 1932/1933, the ""Landibahn trains"" were permanently joined together in pairs with a gangway connection. From then onwards , they the "" Landibahn trains "" operated almost exclusively on line 11 / 12 . In 1933, three new trailers were put into operation: two four-axle trams and one three-axle vehicle, each with an SLM-pony truck.","From then onwards, they operated almost exclusively on line 11/12.","From then onwards, the ""Landibahn trains"" operated almost exclusively on line 11/12.",,
done,"Hay [HEAD] Making and transporting hay ; Early methods [SEP] Early farmers noticed that growing fields produced more fodder in the spring than the animals could consume, and that cutting the grass in the summer, allowing it to dry and storing it for the winter provided their domesticated animals with better quality nutrition than simply allowing them to dig through snow in the winter to find dried grass. Therefore, some fields were ""shut up"" for hay. Up to the end of the 19th century, grass and legumes were not often grown together because crops were rotated. However, by the 20th century, good forage management techniques demonstrated that highly productive pastures were a mix of grasses and legumes, so compromises were made when it was time to mow. Later still, some farmers grew crops, like straight alfalfa (lucerne), for special-purpose hay such as that fed to dairy cattle. Timothy grass and clover were the most common plants used for hay in the early 20th century in the United States, though both plants are native to Europe. Much hay was originally cut by scythe by teams of workers, dried in the field and gathered loose on wagons. Later, haying would be done by horse-drawn implements such as mowers. With the invention of agricultural machinery such as the tractor and the baler, most hay production became mechanized by the 1930s. After hay was cut and had dried, the hay was raked or rowed up by raking it into a linear heap by hand or with a horse-drawn implement. Turning hay, when needed, originally was done by hand with a fork or rake. Once the dried hay was rowed up, pitch forks were used to pile it loose, originally onto a horse-drawn cart or wagon, later onto a truck or tractor-drawn trailer, for which a sweep could be used instead of pitch forks. Loose hay was taken to an area designated for storage—usually a slightly raised area for drainage—and built into a hay stack. The stack was made waterproof as it was built (a skilled task) and the hay would compress under its own weight and cure by the release of heat from the residual moisture in the hay and from the compression forces. The stack was fenced from the rest of the paddock in a rick yard, and often thatched or sheeted to keep it dry. When needed, slices of hay would be cut using a hay knife and fed out to animals each day. On some farms the loose hay was stored in a barrack, shed, or barn, normally in such a way that it would compress down and cure. Hay could be stored in a specially designed barn with little internal structure to allow more room for the hay loft. Alternatively, an upper storey of a cow-shed or stable was used, with hatches in the floor to allow hay to be thrown down into hay-racks below. Depending on region, the term ""hay rick"" could refer to the machine for cutting hay, the hay stack or the wagon used to collect the hay. Hay baling began with the invention of the first hay press in about 1850. Hay was baled for easier handling and to reduce space required for storage and shipment. The first bales weighed about 300 lb. The original machines were of the vertical design similar to the one photographed by Greene Co. Historical Society. They The first hay balers used a horse driven screw press mechanism or a dropped weight to compress the hay . The first patent went to HL Emery for a horse powered, screw operated hay press in 1853. Other models were reported as early as 1843 built by PK Dederick's Sons of Albany, NY, or Samuel Hewitt of Switzerland County, Ohio. Later horizontal machines were devised. One was the “Perpetual Press” made by PK Dederick of Albany, NY, in 1872. They could be powered by steam engines by about 1882.

un,"Ikiza [HEAD] Events ; Hutu uprising [SEP] Between 20:00 and 21:00 on 29 April, Hutu militants began a series of attacks in Bujumbura and across the southern provinces of Rumonge, Nyanza-Lac and Bururi. In each location, the rebels coalesced around a group of individuals that wore a ""uniform"" of black shirts, tattoos, red headbands or white enamel pots splashed with red paint. They operated in bands of about 10–30 individuals and were armed with automatic weapons, machetes, and spears. The militants were joined by Zairean exiles, commonly dubbed ""Mulelists"". Burundi was home to thousands of Zairean exiles who were culturally distinct from other members of Burundian society but had grievances against the Groupe de Bururi and were receptive to the incitement against Micombero's regime. The Mulelist label recalled the name of Pierre Mulele, who had led a rebellion in central Zaire from 1964 to 1965. In reality, the Zairean rebels who fought alongside the Hutu militants were mostly the former followers of Gaston Soumialot, who had led a similar rebellion in eastern Zaire during the same time period. The rebels targeted Tutsis and committed numerous atrocities, as well as burning homes and slaughtering cattle. In Bururi, they murdered all military and civilian authorities. Upon capturing armories in Rumonge and Nyanza-Lac, the militants killed every Tutsi person they encountered and a number of Hutus who refused to join them. Hutu and Tutsi peasants in the town of Vyanda jointly attempted to resist the militants. Missionaries estimated that the rebels murdered 800–1,200 Tutsis and Hutus between 29 April and 5 May, with most victims being Tutsis. Academic René Lemarchand cited 1 , 000–2 , 000 Tutsi deaths as a "" plausible estimate "" . After taking control in the south, the rebels regrouped in Vyanda and declared the creation of the ""République de Martyazo"". Within their territory the rebels hoisted a red and green flag and subjected captured Tutsis to ""people's tribunals"". Late in the evening on 29 April, the Voix de la Révolution broadcast a declaration of a state of emergency. In Bujumbura, the rebels targeted the radio station but lost the element of surprise and quickly resorted to uncoordinated attacks against Tutsis. Army officers swiftly mobilized their troops and neutralised the rebels in the city within 24 hours. That night Ntare was executed at Gitega by government troops. Historians Jean-Pierre Chretien and Jean-François Dupaquier, after evaluating several witness testimonies, concluded that Ntare was shot and stabbed to death by a group of about a dozen soldiers led by Captain Ntabiraho on the orders of Micombero at about 23:15. On 30 April, Micombero quickly restored the public prosecutors Cyrille Nzohabonayo and Bernard Kayibigi to their offices to aid in suppressing the insurgency.

done,"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon [HEAD] Interpretation [SEP] Picasso drew each of the figures in Les Demoiselles differently. The woman pulling the curtain on the upper right is rendered with heavy paint. Composed of sharp geometric shapes, her head is the most strictly Cubist of all five. The curtain seems to blend partially into her body. The Cubist head of the crouching figure (lower right) underwent at least two revisions from an Iberian figure to its current state. She also seems to have been drawn from two different perspectives at once, creating a confusing, twisted figure. The woman above her is rather manly, with a dark face and square chest. The whole picture is in a two-dimensional style, with an abandoned perspective. Much of the critical debate that has taken place over the years centers on attempting to account for this multiplicity of styles within the work. The dominant understanding for over five decades , espoused most notably by Alfred Barr , the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and organizer of major career retrospectives for the artist , has been that it Les Demoiselles d ' Avignon can be interpreted as evidence of a transitional period in Picasso ' s art , an effort to connect his earlier work to Cubism , the style he would help invent and develop over the next five or six years . Suzanne Preston Blier says that the divergent styles of the painting were added intentionally to convey to each women art “style” attributes from the five geographic areas each woman represents. Art critic John Berger, in his controversial 1965 biography The Success and Failure of Picasso, interprets Les Demoiselles d'Avignon as the provocation that led to Cubism: Blunted by the insolence of so much recent art, we probably tend to underestimate the brutality of the Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. All his friends who saw it in his studio were at first shocked by it. And it was meant to shock… A brothel may not in itself be shocking. But women painted without charm or sadness, without irony or social comment, women painted like the palings of a stockade through eyes that look out as if at death – that is shocking. And equally the method of painting. Picasso himself has said that he was influenced at the time by archaic Spanish (Iberian) sculpture. He was also influenced – particularly in the two heads at the right – by African masks…here it seems that Picasso's quotations are simple, direct, and emotional. He is not in the least concerned with formal problems. The dislocations in this picture are the result of aggression, not aesthetics; it is the nearest you can get in a painting to an outrage… I emphasize the violent and iconoclastic aspect of this painting because it is usually enshrined as the great formal exercise which was the starting point of Cubism. It was the starting point of Cubism, in so far as it prompted Braque to begin painting at the end of the year his own far more formal answer to Les Demoiselles d'Avignon…yet if he had been left to himself, this picture would never have led Picasso to Cubism or to any way of painting remotely resembling it…It has nothing to do with that twentieth-century vision of the future which was the essence of Cubism. Yet it did provoke the beginning of the great period of exception in Picasso's life. Nobody can know exactly how the change began inside Picasso. We can only note the results. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, unlike any previous painting by Picasso, offers no evidence of skill. On the contrary, it is clumsy, overworked, unfinished. It is as though his fury in painting it was so great that it destroyed his gifts… By painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon Picasso provoked Cubism. It was the spontaneous and, as always, primitive insurrection out of which, for good historical reasons, the revolution of Cubism developed.","The dominant understanding for over five decades, espoused most notably by Alfred Barr, the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and organizer of major career retrospectives for the artist, has been that it can be interpreted as evidence of a transitional period in Picasso's art, an effort to connect his earlier work to Cubism, the style he would help invent and develop over the next five or six years.","The dominant understanding for over five decades, espoused most notably by Alfred Barr, the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and organizer of major career retrospectives for the artist, has been that Les Demoiselles d'Avignon can be interpreted as evidence of a transitional period in Picasso's art, an effort to connect his earlier work to Cubism, the style he would help invent and develop over the next five or six years.",,

On the last play, of the last game of the season, with the game tied 22-22 against powerful rival Huber Heights Wayne, the pass went to the 165-pound Randy Walker. He was tackled 8 inches (200 mm) from the end zone. After the game the coach, James ""Jim"" Conard, made the entire team walk around with a piece of cloth that was 18 inches (460 mm) long, until the start of the 1970 season. Walker gave up his first love, baseball, joined the track team for speed and stamina, and started lifting weights-gaining 30 pounds, reporting to fall practice at 195-pounds. The 18-inch (460 mm) strip of cloth would motivate his team, Conard and Walker would not lose another game the remaining two seasons, going 20-0, and winning back-to-back WOL titles.

The team and the defense dominated opponents, forcing 31 turnovers, and posting five shutouts (including a 35-0 victory over Wayne). Three backs would be selected to the All-Western Ohio League team, Gordon Bell, Walker, and Joe Allen. Bell, who gained 3,707 yards (3,390 m) in three seasons, rushed for 1,447 yards (on 198 carries) and scored 19 touchdowns in 1971, and was named first team All-Ohio for both 1970 and 1971. Bell would have also been ""Ohio Back of the Year"" had he not finish second, to Archie Griffin (Columbus Eastmoor), in both years. Walker, whose main assignment was to block, rushed for 724 yards (662 m), on a 14.9 yards (13.6 m) per carry average. Allen had 544 yards (497 m) on 67 carries (8.1 YPC).

A railway station with telegraph, a dormitory, a shunting yard, a water tower, a coal shed and a repair shop for steam locomotive were built near lake Edward, 179 km from Québec city, midway to lake St-John. The six service doors of the repair shop (train roundhouse, called the ""Rotonde"") were set in a semi-circle allowing access to steam locomotives on a large turntable. The coming of the railway workers marked the beginning of the village of Lac-Édouard, Quebec. The railway opened a large forested area and wealthy Americans rented tracts of land for hunting and fishing from the Québec government. In 1886, the Triton Fish and Game Club opened on a nearby lake.

Ukrainian intelligence claims that it has a dossier on more than forty Russian military intelligence, or GRU, operatives arrested so far on Ukrainian soil and the weapons and ammunition seized after being transported across the border from Russia. The file is said to describe the role of an alleged GRU colonel, Igor Ivanovich Strielkov, who has been involved in agitation in the east, including his attempts to suborn Ukrainian soldiers with offers of cash. The Ukrainian Security Service have put out a wanted poster for Strielkov, accusing him of a series of charges, included premeditated murder and organizing mass riots.

Most entry-level computer engineering jobs require at least a bachelor's degree in computer engineering (or computer science and engineering). Typically one must learn an array of mathematics such as calculus, algebra and trigonometry and some computer science classes. Sometimes a degree in electronic engineering is accepted, due to the similarity of the two fields. Because hardware engineers commonly work with computer software systems, a strong background in computer programming is necessary. According to BLS, ""a computer engineering major is similar to electrical engineering but with some computer science courses added to the curriculum"". Some large firms or specialized jobs require a master's degree. It is also important for computer engineers to keep up with rapid advances in technology. Therefore , many Computer engineers continue learning throughout their careers . This can be helpful, especially when it comes to learning new skills or improving existing ones. For example, as the relative cost of fixing a bug increases the further along it is in the software development cycle, there can be greater cost savings attributed to developing and testing for quality code as soon as possible in the process, and particularly before release.","Therefore, many continue learning throughout their careers.",Computer engineers continue learning throughout their careers.,,

un,"Tetrahymena [HEAD] DNA repair [SEP] It is common among protists that the sexual cycle is inducible by stressful conditions such as starvation. Such conditions often cause DNA damage. A central feature of meiosis is homologous recombination between non-sister chromosomes. In T. thermophila this process of meiotic recombination may be beneficial for repairing DNA damages caused by starvation. Exposure of T. thermophila to UV light resulted in a greater than 100-fold increase in Rad51 gene expression. Treatment with the DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate also resulted in substantially elevated Rad 51 protein levels. These findings suggest that ciliates such as T. thermophila utilize a Rad51-dependent recombinational pathway to repair damaged DNA. The Rad51 recombinase of T. thermophila is a homolog of the Escherichia coli RecA recombinase. In T . thermophila , Rad51 participates in homologous recombination during mitosis , meiosis and in the repair of double - strand breaks . During conjugation, Rad51 is necessary for completion of meiosis. Meiosis in T. thermophila appears to employ a Mus81-dependent pathway that does not use a synaptonemal complex and is considered secondary in most other model eukaryotes. This pathway includes the Mus81 resolvase and the Sgs1 helicase. The Sgs1 helicase appears to promote the non-crossover outcome of meiotic recombinational repair of DNA, a pathway that generates little genetic variation.","In T. thermophila, Rad51 participates in homologous recombination during mitosis, meiosis and in the repair of double-strand breaks.","In T. thermophila, Rad51 participates in homologous recombination during mitosis, meiosis and in the repair of double-strand breaks.",,

Leslie proposes an automobile race from New York City to Paris and offers the Webber Motor Car Company the opportunity to build an automobile to make the journey. They design and build a new car named ""The Leslie Special"". Fate builds his own race vehicle, ""The Hannibal Twin-8"", complete with hidden devices of sabotage. Other car owners enter the race, including one owned by New York City's most prominent newspaper. Driving the newspaper's car is beautiful photojournalist Maggie DuBois, a vocal suffragist. A seven-car race begins, but Fate's long-suffering sidekick Maximilian Meen has sabotaged four other cars (and his own, by mistake), leaving just three cars in the race. The surviving teams are Leslie with his loyal mechanic Hezekiah Sturdy, Maggie DuBois driving a Stanley Steamer by herself, and Fate and Max. The steamer car breaks down and Maggie accepts a lift in the Leslie Special. Fate arrives first at a refueling point, the small Western frontier town of Boracho. A local outlaw named ""Texas Jack"" becomes jealous of the attraction to Leslie shown by showgirl Lily Olay and a saloon brawl ensues. Fate sneaks outside amidst the chaos, steals the fuel he needs, and destroys the rest. Leslie uses mules to pull his car to another refueling point, where Maggie tricks Hezekiah into boarding a train and handcuffs him to a seat, lying to Leslie that Hezekiah had quit and ""wanted to go back to New York"". The two remaining cars reach the Bering Strait and park side by side in a blinding snowstorm. Keeping warm during the storm, Leslie and Maggie begin to see each other as more than competitors. Mishaps, including a polar bear in Fate's car, compel all four racers to warm themselves in Leslie's car. They awaken on a small ice floe which drifts into their intended Russian port, where Hezekiah is waiting for Leslie, who in turn casts off Maggie for deceiving him. Maggie is snatched by Fate, who drives off in the lead. After driving across Asia, both cars enter the tiny kingdom of Carpania, whose alcoholic and foppish Crown Prince Friedrich Hapnick is the spitting image of Professor Fate.

Unlike most soldiers of the period, who served only in times of war, the celeres were a permanent force, attending the king at all times, including times of peace. They are generally regarded as a cavalry unit, for the Roman kings traveled and fought on horseback, and in his absence the celeres were led by the tribunus celerum, or tribune of the celeres, who doubled as the king's lieutenant and head of the royal household, holding a position analogous to that of the magister equitum under the Roman Republic. However, Dionysius of Halicarnassus states that the celeres fought mounted only where the ground was favourable, dismounting to fight on foot where the ground was unsuitable for cavalry. Numa Pompilius, the second King of Rome, established certain religious rites that the commanders of the celeres were required to perform. The celeres remained the king's bodyguard until the establishment of the Republic in 509 BC. The last tribune of the celeres was Lucius Junius Brutus, the nephew of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last King of Rome, and it was in his capacity as tribune that he convened the comitia curiata to abrogate the king's imperium, while Tarquin was away, besieging Ardea. There was no equivalent body under the early Republic; Roman magistrates were accompanied by the lictors, who had also been established by Romulus, while generals chose the troops they trusted most to protect them. Toward the end of the Republic, veteran soldiers were selected to serve in the cohors praetoria, or praetorian cohort, which in imperial times became the Praetorian Guard.",The celeres (Latin: [ˈkɛɫ̪ɛre:s]) were the bodyguard of the Kings of Rome.,The celeres (Latin: [ˈkɛɫ̪ɛre:s]) were the bodyguard of the Kings of Rome.,,

The new bridge was sited alongside but not parallel to the older, starting close the old structure on the eastern side of the river but reaching the western side well both of the old bridge. The Tyngsboro Bridge shares its open, braced rib design with the Boston University Bridge. Starting in 1975 the bridge was rebuilt, but the cost of the construction generated controversy. In November 2005, the bridge was closed again for repairs following reports of structural deficiency. The temporary Mabey Panel Bridge was constructed alongside of the main bridge and repairs on the main bridge began in 2009. The repair operation was contracted out to S & R Corp. for $16.4 million, but eventually cost $19 million by the completion of the project. This was partially due to delays with steel girders failing stress tests, which required re-engineering, and the discovery that the original bridge had been constructed with lead paint which required S & R Corp. to take measures to ensure that the paint chips did not fall into the river below. The repairs took three years to complete with the bridge reopening in 2012.",The Tyngsborough Bridge was constructed in 1931 to replace the wooden Whipple truss bridge.,The Tyngsborough Bridge was constructed in 1931 to replace the wooden Whipple truss bridge.,,
done,"Binary search tree [HEAD] Operations ; Searching [SEP] Searching in a binary search tree for a specific key can be programmed recursively or iteratively. We begin by examining the root node. If the tree is null, the key we are searching for does not exist in the tree. Otherwise, if the key equals that of the root, the search is successful and we return the node. If the key is less than that of the root, we search the left subtree. Similarly, if the key is greater than that of the root, we search the right subtree. This process is repeated until the key is found or the remaining subtree is null. If the searched key is not found after a null subtree is reached, then the key is not present in the tree. This is easily expressed as a recursive algorithm (implemented in Python): The same algorithm can be implemented iteratively: The following interactive version of the search function does not use parent pointers in the node data structure, instead it uses a stack for holding the pointers to the ancestors. This stack is embedded into a larger structure, called traverser. These three examples do not support duplicates, that is, they consider the tree as totally ordered. One can note that the recursive algorithm is tail recursive. In a language supporting tail call optimization, the recursive and iterative examples will compile to equivalent programs. Because in the worst case this algorithm must search from the root of the tree to the leaf farthest from the root, the search operation takes time proportional to the tree’s height (see tree terminology). On average, binary search trees with Nodes keys have O(log |Nodes|) height. However , in In the worst case , binary search trees can have O ( | Nodes | ) height , when the unbalanced tree resembles a linked list ( degenerate tree ) .

done,"Kenneth Waltz [HEAD] Academic career ; Neorealism [SEP] Waltz's key contribution to the realm of political science is in the creation of neorealism (or structural realism, as he calls it), a theory of international relations that posits that the interaction of sovereign states can be explained by the pressures exerted on them by the anarchic structure of the international system, which limits and constrains their choices. Neorealism thus aims to explain recurring patterns in international relations, such as why relations between Sparta and Athens resembled those between the United States and the Soviet Union in some important ways. Waltz emphasizes repeatedly in the book and elsewhere that he is not creating a theory of foreign policy, which aims to explain the behavior or actions of a particular state at a specific time or throughout a period. For Waltz, neorealism is divided into two branches: defensive and offensive neorealism. Although both branches agree that the structure of the system is what causes states to compete for power, defensive realism posits that most states seek a status quo and limit themselves to concentrate on maintaining the balance of power. Revisionist states are said to be the only states that seek to alter the balance. Offensive neorealism , in contrast to Kenneth Waltz , asserts that nations seek local hegemony over neighboring states to assert authority in local relations with rival states . Waltz argues that contemporary geopolitics exists in a state of international affairs comparable to that of perpetual international anarchy. He distinguishes the anarchy of the international environment from the order of the domestic one. In the domestic realm, all actors may appeal to and be compelled by a central authority, ""the state"" or ""the government,"" but in the international realm, no such source of order exists. The anarchy of international politics, with its lack of a central enforcer, means that states must act in a way that ensures their security above all, or they otherwise risk falling behind. He wrote that is a fundamental fact of political life faced by democracies and dictatorships alike. Except in rare cases, they cannot count on the good will of others to help them and so they must always be ready to fend for themselves. Waltz's usage of the term ""anarchy"" led to a fundamental discursive transformation in international relations, as scholars wrestled with Waltz's ideas. A 2015 study by Jack Donnelly found that the term ""anarchy"" occurred on average 6.9 times in international relations books prior to 1979 but 35.5 times in those afterward. Like most other neorealists, Waltz accepted that globalization poses new challenges to states, but he did not believe that states are being replaced because no other non-state actor can equal the capabilities of the state. Waltz suggested that globalization is a fad of the 1990s, and if anything, the role of the state has expanded its functions in response to global transformations. Neorealism was Waltz's response to what he saw as the deficiencies of classical realism. Although both terms are sometimes used interchangeably, neorealism and realism have a number of fundamental differences. The main distinction between the two theories is that classical realism puts human nature, or the urge to dominate, at the center of its explanation for war, but neorealism stakes a reduced claim on human nature and argues instead that the pressures of anarchy tend to shape outcomes more directly than the human nature of statesmen and diplomats or domestic governmental preferences.","Offensive neorealism, in contrast to Waltz, asserts that nations seek local hegemony over neighboring states to assert authority in local relations with rival states.","Offensive neorealism, in contrast to Kenneth Waltz, asserts that nations seek local hegemony over neighboring states to assert authority in local relations with rival states.",,
un,"History of Korea [HEAD] Three Kingdoms of Korea ; Goguryeo [SEP] Goguryeo was founded in 37 BC by Jumong (posthumously titled as Dongmyeongseong, a royal given title). Later, King Taejo centralized the government. Goguryeo was the first Korean kingdom to adopt Buddhism as the state religion in 372, in King Sosurim's reign. Goguryeo (also spelled as Koguryŏ) was also known as Goryeo (also spelled as Koryŏ), and it eventually became the source of the modern name of Korea. The 3rd and 4th centuries were characterized by territorial competition with the Chinese and Xianbei, resulting in both losses and gains. Goguryeo initiated the Goguryeo–Wei War by attacking a Chinese fortress in 242 in an attempt to cut off Chinese access to its territories in Korea . Cao Wei of the Three Kingdoms of China retaliated by invading and destroying Hwando in 244. This forced the king to flee with Cao Wei in pursuit and broke Goguryeo's rule over the Okjeo and Ye, damaging its economy. The king eventually settled in a new capital, and Goguryeo focused on rebuilding and regaining control. In the early 4th century Goguryeo once again attacked the Chinese (now Sima Jin) to cut off their access to Korea and this time succeeded, and soon afterward conquered Lelang and Daifang ending the Chinese presence in Korea. However Goguryeo's expansion led to confrontation with the rising Xianbeis. The Xianbeis devastated Goguryeo's capital in the mid 4th century and the king retreated. Goguryeo eventually regrouped and began striking back in the late 4th century by King Gogukyang, culminating with the conquests of Gwanggaeto the Great. Goguryeo reached its zenith in the 5th century, becoming a powerful empire and one of the great powers in East Asia, when Gwanggaeto the Great and his son, Jangsu, expanded the country into almost all of Manchuria, parts of Inner Mongolia, parts of Russia, and took the present-day city of Seoul from Baekje. Goguryeo experienced a golden age under Gwanggaeto and Jangsu, who both subdued Baekje and Silla during their times, achieving a brief unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea and becoming the most dominant power of the Korean peninsula. Jangsu's long reign of 79 years saw the perfecting of Goguryeo's political, economic and other institutional arrangements. Goguryeo was a highly militaristic state; in addition to contesting for control of the Korean Peninsula, Goguryeo had many military conflicts with various Chinese dynasties, most notably the Goguryeo–Sui War, in which Goguryeo defeated a huge force traditionally said to number over a million men, and contributed to the Sui dynasty's fall. In 642, the powerful general Yeon Gaesomun led a coup and gained complete control over Goguryeo. In response, Emperor Tang Taizong of China led a campaign against Goguryeo, but was defeated and retreated. After the death of Tang Taizong, his son Emperor Tang Gaozong allied with the Korean kingdom of Silla and invaded Goguryeo again, but was unable to overcome Goguryeo's stalwart defenses and was defeated in 662. However, Yeon Gaesomun died of a natural cause in 666 and Goguryeo was thrown into chaos and weakened by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother, with his eldest son defecting to Tang and his younger brother defecting to Silla. The Tang–Silla alliance mounted a fresh invasion in 667, aided by the defector Yeon Namsaeng, and was finally able to conquer Goguryeo in 668.",Goguryeo initiated the Goguryeo–Wei War by attacking a Chinese fortress in 242 in an attempt to cut off Chinese access to its territories in Korea.,Goguryeo initiated the Goguryeo–Wei War by attacking a Chinese fortress in 242 in an attempt to cut off Chinese access to its territories in Korea.,,

done,"NASCAR Cup Series [HEAD] History ; Winston Cup [SEP] Between 1971 and 2003, NASCAR's premier series was sponsored by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company cigarette brand Winston, dubbing it the Winston Cup Series. The series was originally called the Winston Cup Grand National Series before ""Grand National"" was dropped in 1986. In 1971, the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act banned television advertising of cigarettes. As a result, tobacco companies began to sponsor sporting events as a way to spend their excess advertising dollars and to circumvent the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act's ban on television advertising. RJR's sponsorship became more controversial in the wake of the 1998 Tobacco Industry Settlement that sharply restricted avenues for tobacco advertising, including sports sponsorships. The changes that resulted from RJR ' s involvement in the series NASCAR Cup Series as well as from the reduction in schedule from 48 to 31 races per year established 1972 as the beginning of NASCAR ' s "" modern era "" . The season was made shorter, and the points system was modified several times during the next four years. Races on dirt tracks and on oval tracks shorter than 250 miles (400 kilometres) were removed from the schedule and transferred to the short-lived NASCAR Grand National East Series, and the remaining races had a minimum prize money of $30,000. NASCAR's founder, Bill France Sr., turned over control of NASCAR to his oldest son, Bill France Jr. In August 1974, France Jr. asked series publicist Bob Latford to design a points system with equal points being awarded for all races regardless of length or prize money. This system ensured that the top drivers would have to compete in all the races in order to become the series champion. This system remained unchanged from 1975 until the Chase for the Championship was instituted in 2004. Since 1982, the Daytona 500 has been the first non-exhibition race of the year. ABC Sports aired partial or full live telecasts of Grand National races from Talladega, North Wilkesboro, Darlington, Charlotte, and Nashville in 1970. Because these events were perceived as less exciting than many Grand National races, ABC abandoned its live coverage. Races were instead broadcast, delayed and edited, on the ABC sports variety show Wide World of Sports. In 1979, the Daytona 500 became the first stock car race that was nationally televised live from flag to flag on CBS. The leaders going into the last lap, Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison, wrecked on the backstretch while dicing for the lead, allowing Richard Petty to pass them both for the win. Immediately, Yarborough, Allison, and Allison's brother Bobby were engaged in a fistfight on national television. This underlined the drama and emotion of the sport and increased its broadcast marketability. The race coincided with a major snowstorm along the United States' eastern seaboard, successfully introducing the sport to a captive audience. In 1981, an awards banquet began to be held in New York City on the first Friday evening in December. The first banquets were held in the Waldorf-Astoria's Starlight Room and in 1985 were moved to the much larger Grand Ballroom. But in 2001, the banquet portion was dropped in favor of a simpler awards ceremony. And in 2002, the awards ceremony was moved to the Hammerstein Ballroom at the Manhattan Center. However, in 2003, the festivities returned to the Waldorf's Grand Ballroom, and the banquet format was reinstated.","The changes that resulted from RJR's involvement in the series as well as from the reduction in schedule from 48 to 31 races per year established 1972 as the beginning of NASCAR's ""modern era"".","The changes that resulted from RJR's involvement in the NASCAR Cup Series as well as from the reduction in schedule from 48 to 31 races per year established 1972 as the beginning of NASCAR's ""modern era"".",,
un,"Birthday problem [HEAD] Other birthday problems ; Average number of people to get at least one shared birthday [SEP] In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[n people have at least one shared birthday], this average is determining the mean of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation, which asks for the median. The problem is relevant to several hashing algorithms analyzed by Donald Knuth in his book The Art of Computer Programming. It may be shown that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size M, the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of some individual has expected value n = 1 + Q(M), where has been studied by Srinivasa Ramanujan and has asymptotic expansion: With M = 365 days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is n = 1 + Q(M) ≈ 24.61659, somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of M + 1 = 366 people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required An analysis using indicator random variables can provide a simpler but approximate analysis of this problem.

During Soviet times the area was renamed after the Armenian Bolshevik Stepan Shahumyan, its administrative centre taking the same name. By the 1990s the population of the Shahumyan district was mostly Armenian by language and ethnicity, though the area was not included within the boundaries of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. In the spring/summer of 1991, Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev ordered Operation Ring in which the Soviet Red Army and Azerbaijani OMON surrounded some of the area's Armenian villages (notably Getashen and Martunashen in the neighboring Khanlar District of Azerbaijan SSR) and deported their inhabitants to Armenia. Approximately 17 , 000 Armenians living in Shahumyan ' s 23 villages were deported out of the region . The operation involved the use of ground troops, military, armored vehicles and artillery. The deportations of the Armenian civilians were carried out with gross human rights violations documented by international human rights organizations.

done,"Continuity thesis [HEAD] Franklin and Pasnau [SEP] More recently the Australian mathematician and historian of science James Franklin has argued that the idea of a European Renaissance is a myth. He characterizes the myth as the view that around the 15th century: He claims that the Renaissance was in fact a period when thought declined significantly, bringing to an end a period of advance in the late Middle Ages, and that the twelfth century was the ""real, true, and unqualified renaissance"". For example, the rediscovery of ancient knowledge, which the later Italian humanists claimed for themselves, was actually accomplished in the 12th century. Franklin cites many examples of scientific advances in the medieval period that predate or anticipate later 'discoveries'. For example, the first advances in geometrical optics and mechanics were in the 12th century. The first steps in understanding motion, and continuous variation in general, occurred in the 14th century with the work of the scientists of the Merton School, at Oxford in the 1330s and 1340s. (Franklin notes that there is no phrase in ancient Greek or Latin equivalent to ""kilometres per hour""). Nicole Oresme, who wrote on theology and money, devoted much of his effort to science and mathematics and invented graphs, was the first to perform calculations involving probability, and the first to compare the workings of the universe to a clock. James Franklin emphasises how much of later thought , not only in science , was built on a foundation of revived scholasticism , not Renaissance humanism . But little of importance occurs in any other branches of science in the two centuries between Oresme and Copernicus. Like other historians of this period, Franklin attributes the decline to the plague of 1348–1350, (the black death), which killed a third of the people in Europe. Johan Huizinga's examination of this period, The Waning of the Middle Ages, suggests a tendency towards elaborate theory of signs, which Franklin compares with the degeneracy of modern Marxism. He cites the late Renaissance naturalist Aldrovandi, who considered his account of the snake incomplete until he had treated it in its anatomical, heraldic, allegorical, medicinal, anecdotal, historical and mythical aspects. He marks the 15th century as coinciding with the decline of literature. Chaucer died in 1400; the next writers that are widely read are Erasmus, More, Rabelais and Machiavelli, just after 1500. ""It is hard to think of any writer in English between Chaucer and Spenser who is now read even by the most enthusiastic students.The gap is almost two hundred years."" He points to the development of astrology and alchemy in the heyday of the Renaissance. Franklin concedes that in painting the Renaissance really did excel, but that unfortunately the artistic skill of the Renaissance concealed its incompetence in anything else. He cites Da Vinci, who was supposed to be good at everything, but who on examination, ""had nothing of importance to say on most subjects"". (A standard history of mathematics, according to Franklin (E. T. Bell's The Development of Mathematics, 1940), says that ""Leonardo's published jottings on mathematics are trivial, even puerile, and show no mathematical talent whatever."") The invention of printing he compares to television, which produced ""a flood of drivel catering to the lowest common denominator of the paying public, plus a quantity of propaganda paid for by the sponsors"". The philosopher and historian Robert Pasnau makes a similar, but more extreme claim that ""modernity came in the late twelfth century, with Averroes' magisterial revival of Aristotle and its almost immediate embrace by the Latin West.""","Franklin emphasises how much of later thought, not only in science, was built on a foundation of revived scholasticism, not Renaissance humanism.","James Franklin emphasises how much of later thought, not only in science, was built on a foundation of revived scholasticism, not Renaissance humanism.",,
done,"Miniflex [HEAD] [SEP] Miniflex is an X-ray diffraction (XRD) analytical measuring instrument produced by Rigaku. The current instrument is the fourth in a series introduced in 1973. The Rigaku MiniFlex is historically significant in that it was the first commercial benchtop (tabletop) X-ray diffraction instrument. When introduced in 1973, the original Miniflex was about one-tenth the size, and dramatically less expensive, than conventional X-ray diffraction equipment of the period. The original instrument, and its successor that was introduced in 1976, employed a horizontal goniometer with data output provided by an internal strip chart recorder. The third generation device of the Miniflex X - ray diffraction analytical measuring instrument , introduced in 1995 , was called Miniflex + . It provided a dramatic advance in x-ray power to 450 watts by operating at 30kV and 15mA as well as in the technology with computer control. Both the Miniflex+ and the current generation product employ a vertical goniometer that allowed the use of a 6-position automatic sample changer. The Miniflex II was introduced in 2006 and offered the advance of a monochromatic X-ray source and a 1D silicon strip detector. The fifth generation (Gen 5) MiniFlex600 system, introduced in 2012, built upon this legacy with 600W of tube power and new PDXL powder diffraction software. 2017 saw the introduction of the 6th generation MiniFlex incorporating a 2D hybrid pixel array detector (HPAD) and 8-position automatic sample changer. With the new generation of MiniFlex comes an update to the SmartLab Studio II software. It now offers important new functionality; including a fundamental parameter method (FP) for more accurate peak calculation, phase identification using the Crystallography Open Database (COD), and a wizard for ab inito crystal structure analysis.","The third generation device, introduced in 1995, was called Miniflex+.","The third generation device of the Miniflex X-ray diffraction analytical measuring instrument, introduced in 1995, was called Miniflex+.",,

The character and casting details were announced on 19 July 2018. The show's executive producer Jason Herbison stated that Robards went through ""a full audition process"" and worked with several of the show's actors, before he was cast. Robards commented, ""I've been putting in the work behind closed doors with different coaches – pushing myself out my comfort zone and then this role came up so I'm super excited. I watched Neighbours as a kid so to be on the set with such iconic characters like Paul Robinson, Toadie and Susan is an amazing experience – the entire cast and crew have been so welcoming."" Pierce is a rich investor, who is billed as being a mix of Harvey Specter, Christian Grey and Robert Redford. Mat Whitehead of Ten Daily commented, ""Pierce Greyson – which is exactly the sort of name you'd expect for someone who is as handsome as he may be mysterious – Robards is set to 'arrive in style'."" Pierce also finds romance during his time in Erinsborough. The character departed on 19 November 2018, but on 14 February 2019, Robards announced that he would be reprising the role and joining the full-time cast. Pierce returns during the episode broadcast on 21 May 2019. In August 2020, it was announced that the character would be leaving the show, with Robards originally due to film his final scenes in September. However, Robards chose to finish up four weeks early amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, so he could return to Sydney to be with his wife, who was expecting their first child. Robards stated ""I made the gut-wrenching decision to depart Neighbours early, as my responsibilities as a husband and father have to take precedence."" The role of Pierce Greyson was recast to Don Hany , who said "" I ' m thrilled to have been invited to be part of a show that is part of Australian television history . "" I've never done the show before so it's all new, and I'm so happy to be here. It's a testament to the resilience of the show that it's still running at a time like this."" The character's last scenes aired on 27 November 2020. Hany reprised the role the following year, and Pierce returned on 2 June 2021. Pierce watches on as Chloe Brennan repairs her dress with safety pins, before she greets him and explains that she will be looking after him during his stay at Lassiters Hotel. After a tour of the hotel, Pierce asks Chloe about a Cash4Company business card he found, but she changes the subject. While they are in The Waterhole, Pierce rings the number on the card, having worked out that Chloe is behind the business. Chloe tells him that it is nothing to do with the hotel and offers to resign, but Pierce wants to hire her services. Pierce hires out the Back Lane Bar and then books Chloe's services using a pseudonym, so does not refuse to go on a date with him. Pierce meets with Lassiters Head of Business Affairs Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano) and asks him if Chloe can accompany him on a tour of the Melbourne graffiti laneways. After their night out, Pierce asks Chloe back to his room for sex in return for payment, but Chloe does not go. She reconsiders Pierce's proposal, but after he presents her with a necklace, she leaves without having sex with him. Hotel manager Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) assigns Chloe to assist Pierce with plans for a wine tasting event.

On 14 May, the filly was moved up in class for the Irish 1000 Guineas over one mile at the same course. Ridden as in most of her early races by Christy Roche, she started the 9/2 third choice in a fourteen-runner field with the British-trained Sunbird starting 11/4 favourite ahead of Serenica on 4/1. A quarter of a mile from the finish she appeared to be struggling but stayed on under pressure and as the field entered the final furlong she was disputing the lead alongside Clover Princess, Krassata and Lady Singer. Sarah Siddons took the advantage in the closing stages and won by a length from Clover Princess with Lady Singer a length further back in third.

imp,"Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex [HEAD] Court and military career [SEP] Devereux first came to court in 1584, and by 1587 had become a favourite of the Queen, who relished his lively mind and eloquence, as well as his skills as a showman and in courtly love. In June 1587 he replaced the Earl of Leicester as Master of the Horse. After Leicester's death in 1588, the Queen transferred the late Earl's royal monopoly on sweet wines to Essex, providing him with revenue from taxes. In 1593, he was made a member of her Privy Council. Essex underestimated the Queen, however, and his later behaviour towards her lacked due respect and showed disdain for the influence of her principal secretary, Robert Cecil. On one occasion during a heated Privy Council debate on the problems in Ireland, the Queen reportedly cuffed an insolent Essex round the ear, prompting him to half draw his sword on her. In 1589, he took part in Francis Drake's English Armada, which sailed to Spain in an unsuccessful attempt to press home the English advantage following the defeat of the Spanish Armada, although the Queen had ordered him not to take part. In 1591, he was given command of a force sent to the assistance of King Henry IV of France. In 1596, he distinguished himself by the capture of Cádiz. During the Islands Voyage expedition to the Azores in 1597, with Walter Raleigh as his second-in-command, he defied the Queen's orders, pursuing the Spanish treasure fleet without first defeating the Spanish battle fleet. When the 3rd Spanish Armada first appeared off the English coast in October 1597, the English fleet was far out to sea, with the coast almost undefended, and panic ensued. This further damaged the relationship between the Queen and Essex, even though he was initially given full command of the English fleet when he reached England a few days later. Fortunately a storm dispersed the Spanish fleet. A number of ships were captured by the English and though there were a few landings , the Spanish withdrew .

After a failed attempt to acquire CBS, Turner purchased the film studio MGM/UA Entertainment Co. from Kirk Kerkorian in 1986 for $1.5 billion. Following the acquisition, Turner had amassed enormous debt and sold parts of the acquisition; Kerkorian bought back MGM/UA Entertainment. The MGM/UA Studio lot in Culver City was sold to Lorimar/Telepictures. Turner kept MGM's pre-May 1986 and pre-merger film and television library. Turner Entertainment was established in August 1986 to oversee film and television properties owned by Turner thanks to the deal with Kerkorian. Having now acquired MGM's library of 2,200 films made before 1986, Turner had them syndicated on his nationwide television stations. When broadcasting their older films, he aired colorized versions of ones originally shot in black-and-white. Opposition arose from cinephiles, actors, and directors to Turner's colorization efforts. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote on Turner's broadcasting of a colorized Casablanca, ""that will be one of the saddest days in the history of the movies. It is sad because it demonstrates that there is no movie that Turner will spare, no classic however great that is safe from the vulgarity of his computerized graffiti gangs."" Thanks in part to Turner's colorization, the Library of Congress established the National Film Registry with the aim to preserve American films in their original format. In 1988, Turner purchased Jim Crockett Promotions which he renamed World Championship Wrestling (WCW) which became the main competitor to Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF). This rivalry became known as the Monday Night Wars, and would last throughout the 1990s. In 2001 , under AOL Time Warner , it World Championship Wrestling was sold to the World Wrestling Federation . Also in 1988, he introduced Turner Network Television (TNT) with Gone with the Wind. TNT, initially showing older movies and television shows, added original programs and newer reruns. Turner would later create Turner Classic Movies (TCM) in 1994, airing Turner's pre-1986 MGM library of films alongside those of Warner Bros. made before 1950, though it has expanded its library since. In 1989, Turner created the Turner Tomorrow Fellowship for fiction offering positive solutions to global problems. The winner, from 2500 entries worldwide, was Daniel Quinn's Ishmael. In 1990, he created the Turner Foundation, which focuses on philanthropic grants concerning issues pertaining to the environment and overpopulation. In the same year he created Captain Planet, an environmental superhero. Turner produced the television series Captain Planet and the Planeteers and its later sequel series with Captain Planet as the featured character. In 1992, the pre-May 1986 MGM library, which also included Warner Bros. properties including the early Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies libraries and also the Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios Popeye cartoons from Paramount (and then United Artists), became the core of Cartoon Network. A year before, Turner's companies purchased Hanna-Barbera Productions (whose longtime parent, Taft/Great American Broadcasting, had been headquartered in Turner's original hometown of Cincinnati), beating out several other bidders including MCA Inc. (whose subsidiaries included Universal Pictures and Universal Parks & Resorts) and Hallmark Cards. With the 1996 Time Warner merger, the channel's archives gained the later Warner Bros. cartoon library as well as other Time Warner-owned cartoons. In 1993, Turner and Russian journalist Eduard Sagalajev founded the Moscow Independent Broadcasting Corporation (MIBC). This corporation operated the sixth frequency in Russian television and founded the Russian channel TV-6.

With its far - flung reach and its presence in remote areas , the Indian postal service provides many services such as small savings banking and financial services . As of 31 March 2011, the Indian Postal Service has 154,866 post offices, of which 139,040 (89.78%) are in rural areas and 15,826 (10.22%) are in urban areas. It has 25,464 departmental POs and 129,402 ED BPOs. At the time of independence, there were 23,344 post offices, which were primarily in urban areas. Thus, the network has registered a sevenfold growth since Independence, with the expansion primarily in rural areas. On an average, a post office serves an area of 21.23 sq;km and a population of 7,114 people. India is believed to have the most widely distributed system in the world (China has 57,000, Russia 41,000 and the United States 38,000 offices). This proliferation of offices results from India's history of having many disparate postal systems, eventually unified in the Indian Union after Independence. India has been divided into 22 postal circles, each circle headed by a Chief Postmaster General. Each Circle is further divided into Regions comprising field units, called Divisions, headed by a Postmaster General, and further divided into units headed by SSPOs & SPOs and Sub Divisions headed by ASPs and IPS. Other functional units like Circle Stamp Depots, Postal Stores Depots and Mail Motor Service exist in various Circles and Regions. Besides the 22 circles, there is a special Base Circle to provide the postal services for the Armed Forces of India. The Base Circle is headed by an Additional Director General, Army Postal Service holding the rank of a Major General. Gandhi, Nehru and other historic personalities continued to appear on the postal issues coming from the country since Independence, with almost half a century seeing the Gandhi definitives of denominations most frequently used in the era concerned, becoming synonymous with a postage stamp to the Indian people of that respective time period.

They already possessed a rudimentary food-production technology and probably had a sedentary mindset. Abundant food resources and other natural conditions were a determining factor in the formation and sustenance of the area's dense population. By the time of the second stage, the Tarascan group took control of a vast territory, settling in the Pátzcuaro watershed and setting up a tributary system based on their overwhelming military strength. Together with Tzintzuntzan and Pátzcuaro , Ihuatzio figured among the most important Tarascan settlements .

done,"Sea Peoples [HEAD] Primary documentary records ; Ramesses III narrative [SEP] Ramesses III, the second king of the Egyptian 20th Dynasty, who reigned for most of the first half of the 12th century BCE, was forced to deal with a later wave of invasions of the Sea Peoples—the best-recorded of these in his eighth year. This was recorded in two long inscriptions from his Medinet Habu mortuary temple, which are physically separate and somewhat different from one another. The fact that several civilizations collapsed around 1175 BCE, has led to the suggestion that the Sea Peoples may have been involved at the end of the Hittite, Mycenaean and Mitanni kingdoms. The American Hittitologist Gary Beckman writes, on page 23 of Akkadica 120 (2000): A terminus ante quem for the destruction of the Hittite empire has been recognized in an inscription carved at Medinet Habu in Egypt in the eighth year of Ramesses III (1175 BCE). This text narrates a contemporary great movement of peoples in the eastern Mediterranean, as a result of which ""the lands were removed and scattered to the fray. No land could stand before their arms, from Hatti, Kode, Carchemish, Arzawa, Alashiya on being cut off. [ie: cut down]"" Ramesses' comments about the scale of the Sea Peoples' onslaught in the eastern Mediterranean are confirmed by the destruction of the states of Hatti, Ugarit, Ashkelon and Hazor around this time. As the Hittitologist Trevor Bryce observes: It should be stressed that the invasions of the Sea Peoples were not merely military operations , but involved the movements of large populations , by land and sea , seeking new lands to settle . This situation is confirmed by the Medinet Habu temple reliefs of Ramesses III which show that: the Peleset and Tjekker warriors who fought in the land battle [against Ramesses III] are accompanied in the reliefs by women and children loaded in ox-carts. ""Thou puttest great terror of me in the hearts of their chiefs; the fear and dread of me before them; that I may carry off their warriors (phrr), bound in my grasp, to lead them to thy ka, O my august father, – – – – –. Come, to [take] them, being: Peleset (Pw-r'-s'-t), Denyen (D'-y-n-yw-n'), Shekelesh (S'-k-rw-s). Thy strength it was which was before me, overthrowing their seed, – thy might, O lord of gods."" On the right hand side of the Pylon is the ""Great Inscription on the Second Pylon"", which includes the following text: ""The foreign countries made a conspiracy in their islands, All at once the lands were removed and scattered in the fray. No land could stand before their arms: from Hatti, Qode, Carchemish, Arzawa and Alashiya on, being cut off [i.e. destroyed] at one time. A camp was set up in Amurru. They desolated its people, and its land was like that which has never come into being. They were coming forward toward Egypt, while the flame was prepared before them. Their confederation was the Peleset, Tjeker, Shekelesh, Denyen and Weshesh, lands united. They laid their hands upon the land as far as the circuit of the earth, their hearts confident and trusting: 'Our plans will succeed!'"" The inscriptions of Ramesses III at his Medinet Habu mortuary temple in Thebes record three victorious campaigns against the Sea Peoples considered bona fide, in Years 5, 8 and 12, as well as three considered spurious, against the Nubians and Libyans in Year 5 and the Libyans with Asiatics in Year 11. During Year 8 some Hittites were operating with the Sea Peoples.","It should be stressed that the invasions were not merely military operations, but involved the movements of large populations, by land and sea, seeking new lands to settle.","It should be stressed that the invasions of the Sea Peoples were not merely military operations, but involved the movements of large populations, by land and sea, seeking new lands to settle.",,

The district was part of the Kamarupa kingdom, and was ruled by the Baro-Bhuyans. In the 1580s Nara Narayan of the Kamata kingdom conquered the area Bongaigaon district and it subsequently became the fiefdom of the Bijni family , who were descendants of Nara Narayan . When the Kamata kingdom split into Koch Bihar and Koch Hajo due to rivalry between the king and his nephew Raghu Rai, Bongaigaon became part of Koch Hajo. Soon Koch Hajo and Koch Bihar went to war, and the Mughal Nawab of Dhaka, supporting Koch Bihar, defeated Rai at Dhubri in 1602. Rai's son Parikshit signed a peace treaty, but hostilities resumed in 1614 and Parikshit was driven back to modern-day Guwahati, where he surrendered and soon after died. His son, Bijit Narayan, was made Zamindar of the region between the Manas and Sankosh: from him the Bijni family descended. Koch Hajo was tributary to the Mughals, but in the last decades of the 17th century Mughal influence waned significantly due to the Ahom-Mughal wars in which the Ahoms were eventually successful. Koch Hajo, including Bijni Zamindari, fell under Ahom influence. In the late 1750s, the East India Company strengthened their influence in Bengal and Lower Assam. In 1822 the East India Company created Goalpara district containing present-day Lower Assam, the Garo Hills and northeastern Rangpur division in Bangladesh. The Bijnis continued to pay tribute to the British, and even gained a small amount of land after the Duar War in 1865. Rangpur and the Garo Hills were eventually stripped away to form different districts, but Goalpara continued to be administered as part of a Cooch Behar province. Eventually the Assam Valley province was founded in 1874, and Goalpara was moved to it. Goalpara was later divided into various districts including Kokrajhar and Dhubri, and later Bongaigaon.","In the 1580s Nara Narayan of the Kamata kingdom conquered the area and it subsequently became the fiefdom of the Bijni family, who were descendants of Nara Narayan.","In the 1580s Nara Narayan of the Kamata kingdom conquered the Bongaigaon district and it subsequently became the fiefdom of the Bijni family, who were descendants of Nara Narayan.",,

Prominent among them is one that pre-dates the main tomb itself, by twenty years. Constructed in 1547 CE, it is the tomb complex of Isa Khan Niyazi, an Afghan noble in Sher Shah Suri's court of the Suri dynasty, who fought against the Mughals. The octagonal tomb is positioned within an octagonal garden, which was built during his own lifetime and the reign of Islam Shah Suri, son of Sher Shah. It later served as a burial place for the entire family of Isa Khan. On the western side of the tomb lies a three-bay wide mosque, in red sandstone. The octagonal tomb bears a striking resemblance to other tombs of the Sur dynasty monuments in the Lodhi Gardens, in Delhi and demonstrates a marked progression in the development of the exquisite architectural style of the main tomb. Some of the architectural details present here were seen later in the main Humayun's tomb, though on a much grander scale, such as the tomb being placed in a walled garden enclosure. Bu Halima's Tomb and Garden: When entering the complex from the West, visitor's first enter a garden complex, known as Bu Halima's Garden, though little is known about her, and since the tomb or the raised platform where it once stood is not at the centre, it appears to be a later addition. Afsarwala Tomb and mosque: Standing southwest end of the complex, lies the Afsarwala tomb, dedicated to an unknown person. One of the marble graves inside the tomb is dated 1566-67 CE. The mosque itself can be dated to the same period judging from its siting, standing as it does adjacent to the tomb, rather than away from it. Arab Serai: Literally meaning the sarai (resthouse) for the horses, the structure stands adjacent to the Afsarwala mosque and was built by Bega Begum around 1560-1561 CE, ostensibly built for the craftsmen who came for the construction work.

Nila Gumbad: Standing outside the boundary of the complex is the tomb known as Nila Burj (now known as Nila Gumbad) or 'Blue Dome', so called because it carries striking blue glazed tiles. It was built by Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana, son of Bairam Khan also a courtier in Mughal Emperor, Akbar's court, for his servant Miyan Fahim. Fahim, who not only grew up with his son, but later also died alongside one of Rahim's own sons, Feroze Khan, while fighting against the rebellion of Mughal general Mahabat Khan in 1625/26, during the reign of Jahangir.

The Republican Left of Catalonia was founded on the Conference of the Catalan Left held in Sants, Barcelona, on 19 March 1931 as the union of the independentist Estat Català (Catalan State), led by Francesc Macià, the Catalan Republican Party, led by Lluís Companys and the L'Opinió Group of Joan Lluhí i Vallescà. The party had done extremely well in the municipal elections of 12 April 1931. Two days later, on 14 April, few hours before the proclamation of the Spanish Republic in Madrid, Macià proclaimed in Barcelona the Catalan Republic within the Iberian Federation. This was not exactly what had been agreed in the Pact of San Sebastián, so three days later they negotiated with the Madrid government that Macià would become president of the Generalitat of Catalonia, an autonomous Catalan government within the recently founded Spanish Republic. In September 1932, the Spanish Republican Cortes approved the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia which, among other provisions, granted a Catalan Parliament with full legislative powers, and it was elected on 20 November 1932. The Republican Left of Catalonia, in coalition with the Socialist Union of Catalonia and other minor left-wing parties, won a large majority of seats (67 of 85), while the previously hegemonic Regionalist League, representing a more conservative view of Catalan nationalism, came in second place but far behind ERC (17 from 85). From this strong position, the ERC sought to improve the living conditions of the popular classes and the petite bourgeoisie, approving laws in areas such as in culture, health, education and civil law, and the Crop Contracts Law, which protected tenant farmers and granted access to the land they were cultivating, but it was contested by the Regionalist League and provoking a legal dispute with the Spanish government. In October 1933 , Joan Lluhí and other members of the l ' Opinió Group , as well Josep Tarradellas , left the Republican Left of Catalonia ( ERC ) because there were in disagree with Macià over the distribution of powers between the Executive Council and the President of the Generalitat , and founded the Nationalist Republican Left Party ( PNRE ) . On 6 October 1934, Lluís Companys, who had been elected by the Parliament of Catalonia as the new President of the Generalitat after the death of Francesc Macià in December 1933, following the entry of right-wing ministers of the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) into the Government of the Spanish Republic, unlawfully declared a Catalan State within a Spanish Federal Republic. CEDA was considered close to fascism and, therefore, it was feared that this was the first step towards suppressings the autonomy and taking complete power in Spain. The proclamation was quickly suppressed by the Spanish army, and the Catalan government was arrested. The party leaders (including Companys itself) and the Catalan government were sentenced by the Supreme Court of the Republic and jailed, while the Statute of Autonomy was suspended until February 1936. In 1936, at the dawn of the Spanish Civil War, ERC became part of the Popular Front to contest that year's election. Esquerra became the leading force of the Popular Front, (called Front d'Esquerres, ""Left Front"" in Catalan) in Catalonia, which it won 41 from 54 Catalan seats, 21 of them belonging to ERC. The new left-wing Spanish government pardoned Companys and the members of the Catalan government, restoring the self-government. In June Estat Català split from ERC, while the PNRE rejoined it.","In October 1933, Joan Lluhí and other members of the l'Opinió Group, as well Josep Tarradellas, left ERC because there were in disagree with Macià over the distribution of powers between the Executive Council and the President of the Generalitat, and founded the Nationalist Republican Left Party (PNRE).","In October 1933, Joan Lluhí and other members of the l'Opinió Group, as well Josep Tarradellas, left the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) because there were in disagree with Macià over the distribution of powers between the Executive Council and the President of the Generalitat, and founded the Nationalist Republican Left Party (PNRE).",,

He operated a tea garden and plant nursery here too, until at least 1891. The Roseneath Estate began to be developed in 1886 and possibly took its name from Wilkinson's business. Sections covering an area from Point Jerningham to Grafton Road down to Evans Bay were released for sale in 1888 and another block covering an area from Grafton Road up the hillside was for sale in 1902. Walking access from Oriental Bay to Roseneath begins at the top of Grass Street outside Wilkinson's house, now 13 Grass Street and on a terrace at the foot of Wilkinson Street. St Barnabas Anglican church on Maida Vale Rd was dedicated on 19 November 1899. In January 1924 there was a serious fire in the wooden church, but it was rebuilt. Gateways Apartments at 19 Maida Vale Rd , next to the church and school in Roseneath , Wellington , is a large modernist block of 60 flats built in the 1960s . The headland forming the northern part of Roseneath is called Point Jerningham. A concrete lighthouse was installed in the water off the point in January 1929, replacing an earlier floating light. The lighthouse was transported to the site and lowered into position by the floating crane Hikitia. In 2019 a solar LED beacon was installed in the lighthouse. Point Jerningham is also the site of New Zealand's only permanent saluting battery, which began operating in 1918. The New Zealand Army fires four 25-pound guns on special occasions, for example a 21-gun salute for the birthday of Queen Elizabeth II. Next to the saluting battery is the Long Hall. This building was originally a military barracks situated at Mt Victoria during World War 2. In 1947 members of the RSA moved it to its current site and used it as a clubrooms. After 1969 the hall was used as a practice space for Wellington Scottish Pipes and Drums and other uses.

We were more or less knocked out by it, because we never dreamed that the debut was such a strong one. As a matter of fact, we weren't ready for it. Pussycat was a kind of a hobby for us then. For instance, I was still working. Our lives went on an overdrive. We could not keep our jobs as typists as we were dragged all over the place, from one show to the other. ""Mississippi"" has made all our dreams come true. Everywhere the three of us go, we still get asked to sing it. Over the years we may have sung the song over ten thousand times, but we will never get tired of it!. – Toni remembering the commotion around their debut. The particular country sound in our songs certainly has to do with our voices, which contain a country like warmth. But we can just as easily sing jazz or black music preferably old fashioned soul. Our producer Pim Koopman was also partly responsible for our change of sound. – Toni talks about the country sound in their music ""Mississippi"" was another song composed by Werner Theunissen. It was written in the same vein as ""Massachusetts"" by the Bee Gees, a song he liked very much. The band started to play the song live for a few months and later they sent a demo of it to EMI Bovema in Heemstede, who were immediately interested. They ended up re-recording the song in the EMI Studio. But this did not work out as planned. Their Pussycat ' s producer at that time Eddy Hilberts who had success with a repertoire of country songs gave a country like twist to the song Mississippi . Personally the sisters did not have anything with country music, although influenced by 'The Eagles', they liked country rock. ""Mississippi"" was released as a single in April 1975. Initially, it did nothing, until Meta de Vries, the Dutch radio jockey started playing it. She thought Pussycat was an English band. Hans Van Willigenburg played the song on his radio programme as well. During his broadcast, he would play three new songs, after which listeners could vote by postcard which artist should be invited to his studio. They voted for Pussycat. The group also performed the song for the TV show 'Herkent U Deze Tijd' by Kick Stokhuyzen. The same week the single entered the Top 40 in November 1975. The following week, they performed ""Mississippi""' at TopPop and a week later, the single had climbed to # 1. Although Toni and Marianne still worked as typists for DSM, they were unable to maintain their jobs as besides the Netherlands, ""Mississippi"" had become No. 1 in Germany as well. As their fame grew, the band realized they needed a manager, so their record company got them their new manager Jan Buys. Oddly enough, at first they did not want to release the single in Germany nor UK because of the initial lack of interest. Eventually, the single was released in the U.K. on Sonet, a small record label. In the fall of 1976, the single was number 1 in the UK charts. In addition to the Netherlands, Germany and U.K., the single was #1 in Austria, Switzerland, Norway and Brazil.

un,"Lord Howe Island Marine Park [HEAD] History of management ; Management practices [SEP] In 1999, the Commonwealth's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) was enacted. The EPBC Act provides guidance about regional biodiversity conservation priorities through the implementation of the marine bioregional planning process. This process conserves marine biodiversity by considering the whole ecosystem a species is in and how different species interact in the marine environment. This process identified the regional conservation priorities in a number of different marine regions and identified the marine reserves to be added to Australia's National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas. Lord Howe Island Marine park was identified as requiring protection . To protect the various marine conservation values associated with the waters around Lord Howe Island, the New South Wales government proclaimed the Lord Howe Island Marine Park in 1999. However, it wasn't until 2004 that a zoning scheme came into force due to lengthy negotiations with stakeholders. This zoning scheme partitioned the coastal waters of Lord Howe Island to permit different human uses, in order to minimise the threat to marine conservation values. The objectives of the zoning plan under the Marine Parks Act 1997 include: 1) to conserve marine biological diversity and marine habitats, 2) to maintain ecological processes, 3) where consistent with the preceding, to provide for ecologically sustainable use of fish and marine vegetation, and 4) to provide opportunities for public appreciation, understanding and enjoyment. The zoning plan for the Lord Howe Island Marine Park provides various levels of biodiversity protection, regulating activities according to zones. 73.2% of the Marine Park, known as Habitat Protection Zones, allows most forms of fishing: charter boat and recreational, but excludes spearfishing. The other 26.8% of the Marine Park are zoned as seven Sanctuary Zones, where fishing, anchoring and other harmful human activities are excluded. While 0.004% (1.7ha) of the marine park is considered a Special Purpose Zone used for special management needs, specifically to allow limited fish feeding. Lord Howe Island Marine park does not contain any General Use zones, like other Marine Parks in New South Wales. The zoning plan also contains regulations on specific activities and provides additional protection on species of particular importance. The zoning plan gives protection to important natural and cultural values of the marine park, while allowing sustainable use including swimming, surfing, charter and recreational fishing, scuba diving, sailing, boating and research.

done,"Tooth resorption [HEAD] Classifications ; External resorption ; Replacement [SEP] External replacement resorption occurs following ankylosis of the root of the alveolar bone. The tooth tissue is resorbed and replaced with bone. This process is poorly understood. It is thought that following the union of bone and tooth and the obliteration of the PDL, the protective regulators released by the PDL to protect the root from resorption are no longer present. This results in the tooth tissue being resorbed by osteoclasts and replaced with bone like it was part of the continuous homeostatic process of bone turnover. There is currently no single best intervention or treatment for the management of external root resorption.

They differ from other phyla in that other phyla may have cartilage or cartilage-like tissues forming a sort of skeleton, but only vertebrates possess what we define as bone. Classes of vertebrates listed in chronological order from oldest to most recent include heterostracans, osteostracans, coelolepid agnathans, acanthodians, osteichthyan fishes, chondrichthyan fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. All vertebrates are studied under standard evolutionary generalizations of behavior and life process, although there is controversy over whether population can be accurately estimated from limited fossil resources. Evolutionary origins of vertebrates as well as the phylum Chordata have not been scientifically determined. Many believe vertebrates diverged from a common ancestor of chordates and echinoderms . This belief is well supported by the prehistoric marine creature Amphioxus. Amphioxus does not possess bone, making it an invertebrate, but it has common features with vertebrates including a segmented body and a notochord.

un,"History of Mongolia [HEAD] Modern period ; Mongolian People's Republic [SEP] Thus the Revolution ended Chinese occupation of Mongolia and defeated White Russian forces in Mongolia. Also that year, Mongolian revolutionary leaders adopted the Statement of Reunification of Mongolia. In 1924, during secret meetings with the Republic of China, the Soviet Union agreed to China's claim to Mongolia. The Soviet Union officially recognized Mongolian independence in 1945. The revolutionary government kept Bogd Khan as nominal head of state, but the actual power was in the hands of the MPP and its Soviet (especially Buryat and Kalmyk) counselors. After the mysterious death of Bogd Khan in 1924, the MPP moved quickly to promulgate a Soviet-style constitution, abolishing monarchy and declaring the Mongolian People's Republic on 26 November 1924. Mongolia became completely isolated from the world by the MPP government, which followed the Soviet Union in implementing the Communist experiment. On the other hand, this also provided protection against the potential aggression of China. In 1928, Mongolian politics took a sharp leftward turn. Herds were forcibly collectivized, private trade and transport were forbidden, and monasteries and the nobility came under attack. This led to an economic breakdown and to widespread unrest and armed uprisings in 1932. The MPP and Soviet troops defeated the rebels in October. But as a result, the MPP withdrew its most aggressively socialist policies, as advised by the Comintern, instead adopting the Шинэ эргэлтийн бодлого (Shine ergeltiin boglogo, the so-called ""Policy of the New Turn""). The ""New Turn"" included the purging of the most leftist members of the leadership under the pretext of нугалаа (nugalaa ""bending"") and liberalized development of the economy, and was favored by new leaders such as Prime Minister P. Genden. However, they did not realize that this was a temporary tactical retreat by Stalin and the Comintern. Another wave of repressions began in 1937, presided over by Khorloogiin Choibalsan, and resulted in the almost complete elimination of the Buddhist clergy. The Buryat Mongols started to migrate to Mongolia in the 1900s due to Soviet oppression. Stalin stopped the migration in 1930 and initiated repressions in Mongolia against both immigrants and native Mongolians. During the Stalinist repressions in Mongolia, presided over by Khorloogiin Choibalsan, many Buryat men and 22,000–33,000 Mongols were killed by NKVD orders. The victims were 3%–5% of the total population, and included monks, Pan-Mongolists, nationalists, patriots, military officers, nobles, intellectuals, and common citizens. Some authors also offer much higher estimates, up to 100,000 victims. At this time, Mongolia had an overall population of about 700,000 to 900,000 people. The proportion of victims to the total population was much higher than during the Great Purge in the Soviet Union. In 1939, Soviet and Mongolian troops fought against Japan in the Battle of Khalkhyn Gol, in Eastern Mongolia. In August 1945, at the end of World War II, Mongolian troops took part in the Soviet operations against Japan in Inner Mongolia. Russian historian Viktor Suvorov wrote that in the Soviet war with Germany, Mongolian aid was as important as American aid, because warm clothes decided victory or defeat in the battles. Also in August 1945 , the Republic of China had finally agreed to recognize Mongolia ' s independence if a vote were held . The vote took place in the presence of Chinese observers on 20 October.

un,"History of alternative medicine [HEAD] Histories of individual traditional medical systems ; Ayurvedic medicine [SEP] Ayurveda or ayurvedic medicine has more than 5,000 years of history, now re-emerging as texts become increasingly accessible in modern English translations. These texts attempt to translate the Sanskrit versions that have remained hidden in India since British occupation from 1755 to 1947. As modern archaeological evidence from Harappa and Mohenja-daro is distributed, Ayurveda has now been accepted as the world's oldest concept of health and disease discovered by man and the oldest continuously practiced system of medicine. Ayurveda is a world view that advocates man's allegiance and surrender to the forces of Nature that are increasingly revealed in modern physics, chemistry and biology. It is based on an interpretation of disease and health that parallels the forces of nature, observing the sun's fire and making analogies to the fires of the body; observing the flows in Nature and describing flows in the body, terming the principle as Vata; observing the transformations in Nature and describing transformations in the body, terming the principle as Pitta; and observing the stability in Nature and describing stability in the body, terming the principle as Kapha. Ayurveda can be defined as the system of medicine described in the great medical encyclopedias associated with the names Caraka , Suśruta , and Bheḷa , compiled and re - edited over several centuries from about 200 BCE to about 500 CE and written in Sanskrit . These discursive writings were gathered and systematized in about 600 CE by Vāgbhaṭa, to produce the Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā ('Heart of Medicine Compendium') that became the most popular and widely used textbook of ayurvedic medicine in history. Vāgbhaṭa's work was translated into many other languages and became influential throughout Asia. Its prehistory goes back to Vedic culture and its proliferation in written form flourished in Buddhist times. Although the hymns of the Atharvaveda and the Ṛgveda mention some herbal medicines, protective amulets, and healing prayers that recur in the ciphered slokas of later ayurvedic treatises, the earliest historical mention of the main structural and theoretical categories of ayurvedic medicine occurs in the Buddhist Pāli Tripiṭaka, or Canon. Ayurveda originally derived from the Vedas, as the name suggests, and was first organized and captured in Sanskrit in ciphered form by physicians teaching their students judicious practice of healing. These ciphers are termed slokas and are purposefully designed to include several meanings, to be interpreted appropriately, known as 'tantra yukti' by the knowledgeable practitioner. Ayu means longevity or healthy life, and veda means human-interpreted and observable truths and provable science. The principles of Ayurveda include systematic means for allowing evidence, including truth by observation and experimentation, pratyaksha; attention to teachers with sufficient experience, aptoupadesha; analogy to things seen in Nature, anumana; and logical argument, yukti.","Ayurveda can be defined as the system of medicine described in the great medical encyclopedias associated with the names Caraka, Suśruta, and Bheḷa, compiled and re-edited over several centuries from about 200 BCE to about 500 CE and written in Sanskrit.","Ayurveda can be defined as the system of medicine described in the great medical encyclopedias associated with the names Caraka, Suśruta, and Bheḷa, compiled and re-edited over several centuries from about 200 BCE to about 500 CE and written in Sanskrit.",,
un,"Stadium of Light [HEAD] Name [SEP] During construction, the stadium had not adopted an official name, and had been known colloquially as the ""Wearside Stadium"" and ""New Roker Park"". The name was eventually revealed as the Stadium of Light at a naming ceremony on 30 July 1997, hours before the opening game against Ajax. Speaking at the naming event, Bob Murray explained the inspiration for the name came from the Coal mining heritage of the region and the stadium's Monkwearmouth Colliery site: ""For many years, miners at Wearmouth Colliery carried with them a Davy lamp as part of their working lives. Reflecting this tradition, the name allows the image of this light to shine forever."" To emphasise the fact, a statue of a miner's Davy lamp was located in front of the stadium's ticket office, adjacent to the stadium. The name initially drew mixed reactions from Sunderland fans many unhappy that the name was already associated with the home ground of S.L. Benfica. A film crew for the Premier Passions documentary series, recorded the moment that Bob Murray faced Sunderland fans immediately after the naming with many expressing their disappointment. The similarity to the name of Benfica's home, Estádio da Luz, often anglicised to The Stadium of Light, has led to some visiting fans and reporters to erroneously assume that Sunderland's home was named after the Portuguese stadium. Murray responded directly to this in a 2017 interview with the Evening Chronicle, in which he said ""The Estadio de Luz in Portugal isn’t the Stadium of Light, it is named after the area – Luz. It’s like, say, Elland Road or Old Trafford. We are the only club whose stadium has that name, and it was because of the history of the region that I named it"". In the same interview, Murray revealed that shortly after the stadium opened he was approached by a representative of the Labour government asking if he would consider renaming the stadium after Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in September 1997. Murray refused the request as he believed the stadium should be named in honour of those in the region who had worked in darkness. The ' Of Light ' suffix became a recognisable part of the Sunderland A . F . C . brand, and was used in a number of other areas related to the club; the Academy of Light is the club's training facility and youth academy, the Foundation of Light is a registered charity affiliated with the club and the Beacon of Light is a sports and education centre, owned by the Foundation, which is adjacent to the stadium. The club's official magazine was called Legion of Light before it was discontinued in January 2017. In March 2010, Sunderland Chairman Niall Quinn announced the club were considering plans to sell naming rights to the stadium as a new way to boost income. The plans were shelved shortly after. The possibility of selling the naming rights was floated again by chief executive Margaret Byrne in 2013. Discussing the options of selling the stadium name in October 2018, chairman Stewart Donald said: ""I think the fans should have a say on whether they are comfortable with it. My gut feel is that even if we didn't consult with them, the vibe I get is that they aren't particularly attached to the name of the stadium. It's not a sacred thing like some of the other grounds.""",The 'Of Light' suffix became a recognisable part of the Sunderland A.F.C.,The 'Of Light' suffix became a recognisable part of the Sunderland A.F.C.,,
imp,"Women in the Bible [HEAD] Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) ; Sex, marriage and family ; The Levite's concubine [SEP] The Levite's concubine in the book of Judges is ""vulnerable as she is only a minor wife, a concubine"". She is one of the biblical nameless. Frymer-Kensky says this story is also an example of class intersecting with gender and power: when she is unhappy she runs home, only to have her father give her to another, the Levite. The Levite and his concubine travel to a strange town where they are vulnerable because they travel alone without extended family to rescue them; strangers attack. To protect the Levite, his host offers his daughter to the mob and the Levite sends out his concubine. Trible says ""The story makes us realize that in those days men had ultimate powers of disposal over their women."" Frymer - Kensky says the scene is similar to one in the Sodom and Gomorrah story when Lot sent his daughters to the mob , but in Genesis the angels save them , and in the book of Judges God is no longer intervening . The concubine is raped to death. The Levite butchers her body and uses it to rouse Israel against the tribe of Benjamin. Civil war follows nearly wiping out an entire tribe. To resuscitate it, hundreds of women are captured and forced into marriage. Fryman-Kensky says, ""Horror follows horror."" The narrator caps off the story with ""in those days there was no king in Israel and every man did as he pleased."" The decline of Israel is reflected in the violence against women that takes place when government fails and social upheaval occurs. According to Old Testament scholar Jerome Creach, some feminist critiques of Judges say the Bible gives tacit approval to violence against women by not speaking out against these acts. Frymer-Kensky says leaving moral conclusions to the reader is a recognized method of writing called gapping used in many Bible stories. Biblical scholar Michael Patrick O'Connor attributed acts of violence against women described in the Book of Judges to a period of crisis in the society of ancient Israel before the institution of kingship. Yet others have alleged such problems are innate to patriarchy.","Frymer-Kensky says the scene is similar to one in the Sodom and Gomorrah story when Lot sent his daughters to the mob, but in Genesis the angels save them, and in the book of Judges God is no longer intervening.","Frymer-Kensky says the scene is similar to one in the Sodom and Gomorrah story when Lot sent his daughters to the mob, but in Genesis the angels save them, and in the book of Judges God is no longer intervening.",,

By the French Revolutionary Wars of the late 18th century, effective naval convoy tactics had been developed to ward off pirates and privateers. Some During the Age of Sail , some convoys contained several hundred merchant ships . The most enduring system of convoys were the Spanish treasure fleets, that sailed from the 1520s until 1790. When merchant ships sailed independently, a privateer could cruise a shipping lane and capture ships as they passed. Ships sailing in convoy presented a much smaller target: a convoy was as hard to find as a single ship. Even if the privateer found a convoy and the wind was favourable for an attack, it could still hope to capture only a handful of ships before the rest managed to escape, and a small escort of warships could easily thwart it. As a result of the convoy system's effectiveness, wartime insurance premiums were consistently lower for ships that sailed in convoys. Many naval battles in the Age of Sail were fought around convoys, including: By the end of the Napoleonic Wars the Royal Navy had in place a sophisticated convoy system to protect merchant ships. Losses of ships travelling out of convoy however were so high that no merchant ship was allowed to sail unescorted.",Some convoys contained several hundred merchant ships.,"During the Age of Sail, some convoys contained several hundred merchant ships.",,

In December 2016 Foreign Minister Janelidze and the Minister of State for Europe and the Americas Sir Alan Duncan announced that the countries have upgraded bilateral political dialogue to the level of Strategic Partnership. ""We are developing not only our bilateral cooperation but our partnership in multilateral formats. We look forward to establishing a strong legal framework after Brexit including developing free trade and trade-economic cooperation”, Minister Janelidze said at the meeting in London with the U.K. Secretary of State Boris Johnson. Janelidze and Steinmeier, the Foreign Minister of Germany, agreed that there was potential for Georgia and Germany to enhance trade and economic ties and encourage greater inflow of German investments to Georgia during the meeting in Berlin in 2016. The start of the Georgian-German Year, an 18-month-long series of cultural and political events celebrating the 200 years of friendship and 25 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries, were officially announced by Janelidze and German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel at an official reception evening attended by over 500 guests in April 2017. “We’ want to ensure that co-operation between Georgia and Germany grows into deep partnership” – stated Janelidze. Jean-Marc Ayrault, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Development, received Minister Janelidze in Paris on February 7, 2017. Addressing the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly on February 8 , Janelidze stated that Georgia is the EU’s “main ally in the area of security” and underlined that “having such a democratic and stable ally as Georgia is in the interests of Europe . ” France and Georgia are launching a high - level dialogue named after Georgian prince Dimitri Amilakhvari - the French Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs , Jean - Yves Le Drian said at a joint press conference of the foreign ministers of the two countries in Tbilisi on the 26th of May 2018 . The dialogue moved up Georgian-French relations to a qualitatively new level. Italy's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Paolo Gentiloni, after his meeting with Janelidze in Tbilisi said that the Government of Georgia has ""worked hard” to create beneficial situation for European businesses to invest in the country and stressed that after Georgia signed its Association Agreement (AA) and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) deal with the European Union (EU), more European business people had shown interest in investing in Georgia. Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs and Co-operation Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo visited Tbilisi on 28–29 February 2016. Janelidze assessed this visit as a strong support of the Spanish Government to Georgia and welcomed the political decision of Spain to open the embassy in Georgia. Didier Reynders, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Affairs of Belgium hosted Mikheil Janelidze in October 2017. Highlighting the opportunities of further deepening co-operation in the areas of infrastructure, energy and green technologies, the two ministers spoke about the Belgian business delegation’s upcoming visit to Georgia. Mikheil Janelidze worked intensively with such traditional supporters of Georgia, its European and Euroatlantic integration, as Baltic and Visegrad countries. In the frames of Mikheil Janelidze’s visit to the Republic of Poland, Georgian and Polish Foreign Ministers launched - a new format for co-operation between Georgia and Poland, which represents a platform supporting Georgia’s European and Euro-Atlantic integration.

done,"Abu Ali Iyad [HEAD] Fatah command ; Commander in Jordan [SEP] He moved to Jordan in 1968 where he trained Fatah forces in Ajlun. Palestinian fedayeen activity persisted following the collective Arab defeat in the 1967 Six-Day War and Israel sought to end guerrilla attacks on its territory by launching an offensive against the Palestinian Liberation Organization's (PLO) bases in Jordan. A major confrontation ensued between the Israeli Army and Fatah which came to be known as the Battle of Karameh. Abu Ali Iyad was a senior commander during the battle, gaining prominence and respect among the Palestinians for his performance as an unyielding military officer. Although Fatah took heavy losses, Israel eventually withdrew after the Jordanian Army entered the fray on Fatah's side. He continued to organize raids against Israeli army camps and towns in Israel and the West Bank while he was based in Jordan. Relations between the PLO and King Hussein of Jordan began to deteriorate after Karameh, climaxing in September 1970 when armed conflict ensued between Palestinian and Jordanian forces. Prior to Jordanian military action, Abu Ali Iyad lobbied his colleagues in Fatah, who supported the forced ousting of the king, to withdraw from Amman and return to the countryside closer to the border with Israel. Palestinian factions did not heed his calls and their military bases in Amman were shelled by Jordanian forces. On September 17, an emergency meeting of PLO factions was held with the majority of those attending favoring confrontation with King Hussein's troops. Supporting al-Wazir, who was one of the few delegates to have reservations, Abu Ali Iyad argued against confrontation and warned that expectations of Syrian intervention on the side of the Palestinians was improbable. The Jordanians succeeded in defeating PLO forces in Amman and about 2,000 Palestinian guerrillas under al-Wazir's leadership evacuated the city northward to Ajlun. Abu Ali Iyad was part of the field command there along with al-Wazir. They headed a force of roughly 2,500 guerrillas in the hilly terrain around Ajlun and Jerash. Their Abu Ali Iyad ' s position was vulnerable due to the ineffectiveness of Palestinian guerrilla warfare against Jordanian armor in open areas versus urban warfare in the cities and Palestinian refugee camps . Most of the PLO leadership, including Arafat and al-Wazir, and hundreds of guerrillas escaped Jordan in April 1971 following pressure from Arab states, confiscation of weapons by the Jordanian Army and the closing of PLO offices in Amman. Abu Ali Iyad refused to do so, however, and he and his Tiger Cubs stayed put in their Ajlun base where they continued to fight the Jordanian Army. On July 12, King Hussein ordered the evacuation of all guerrilla forces from the strategic mountain in the center of their stronghold in Ajlun. Hussein personally offered to allow Abu Ali Iyad to depart unharmed if he abandoned his fighters. He refused and Hussein ordered his troops to track down and kill him within the framework of routing out remaining PLO forces in northern Jordan. A Jordanian infantry division and armored brigade backed by 10,000 Bedouin foot soldiers immediately launched an offensive afterward. By July 16, Palestinian positions had been secured by the Jordanian Army. During the Jordanian offensive, 200-250 guerrillas had been killed and 70-100 of Abu Ali's troops fled, crossing the Jordan River to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",Their position was vulnerable due to the ineffectiveness of Palestinian guerrilla warfare against Jordanian armor in open areas versus urban warfare in the cities and Palestinian refugee camps.,Abu Ali Iyad's position was vulnerable due to the ineffectiveness of Palestinian guerrilla warfare against Jordanian armor in open areas versus urban warfare in the cities and Palestinian refugee camps.,,

done,"Fluorescence intermittency in colloidal nanocrystals [HEAD] Random behavior [SEP] Studies of single colloidal nanocrystals show that they randomly turn their photoluminescence on and off even under continuous light illumination. This tends to hinder progress for engineers and scientists who study single colloidal nanocrystals and try to use their fluorescent properties for biological imaging or lasing. The blinking in nanocrystals was first reported in 1996. The discovery was unexpected. The consensus is that blinking happens because illuminated nanocrystals can be charged (or ionized), and then neutralized. Under normal conditions when nanocrystal is neutral, a photon excites an electron-hole pair, which then recombines, emitting another photon and leading to photoluminescence. This process is called radiative recombination. If however, the nanocrystal is charged, the extra carrier triggers a process called non-radiative Auger recombination, where exciton energy is transferred to an extra electron or hole. Auger recombination occurs orders of magnitude faster than the radiative recombination. So photoluminescence is almost entirely suppressed in charged nanocrystals. Scientists still do not fully understand the origin of the charging and neutralization process. One of the photoexcited carriers (the electron or the hole) must be ejected from the nanocrystal. At some later time , the ejected charge returns to the nanocrystal ( restoring charge neutrality and therefore radiative recombination ) . The details of how these processes occur still are not understood.","At some later time, the ejected charge returns to the nanocrystal (restoring charge neutrality and therefore radiative recombination).","At some later time, the ejected charge returns to the nanocrystal (restoring charge neutrality and therefore radiative recombination).",,

She got underway 23 January for the invasion of the Marshalls, as American amphibious task forces picked up momentum in their drive toward Japan. Steaming as a forward picket ship, Hopewell arrived off Kwajalein on 31 January and delivered gunfire support during the initial assault. That night she bombarded Roi and Namur Islands and 1 February moved to screening and patrol duties off the other islands of the group. With the success of the landings assured, Hopewell sailed to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 24 February. The destroyer arrived at Purvis Bay, Florida Islands on 14 March to take part in the developing offensive on the northern coast of New Guinea. She carried out screening and patrol assignments, and contributed shore bombardment during the Aitape landings, part of the bold Hollandia operation. After Aitape, an unopposed operation carried out 22 April, Hopewell remained with 7th Fleet patrolling and screening. With three other destroyers she carried out a bombardment of Japanese positions on New Ireland on 29 May, and in June joined escort carrier Hoggatt Bay on antisubmarine patrol. Hopewell's next operation was the invasion of Morotai, necessary as an air base for the Philippines campaign to come. She arrived 16 September, the day after the initial landing, to assume screening duties, and shot down an attacking Japanese plane that day. On 18 September, she supported an auxiliary landing on Morotai, and sailed 25 September with a convoy for Humboldt Bay. The invasion of the Philippines began with the Leyte landings 20 October , and four days later the USS Hopewell arrived with a reinforcement group . A damaged propeller kept her from taking part in the four-part Battle of Leyte Gulf, in which the Imperial Japanese Navy suffered defeat on 24–25 October. Next day she departed in the van of a convoy and shaped course for Humboldt Bay, where repairs could be effected. At the eastern entrance to the Gulf the convoy was attacked, and in the battle that followed Hopewell made concealing smoke and shot down two aircraft. The ship sailed again 8 November for Leyte, and after two trips from Humboldt Bay and return with convoys, she joined the Mindoro invasion forces. After fighting off heavy air attacks en route, Hopewell arrived off the assault area 15 December and provided fire support as troops stormed ashore. As air attacks continued, the ship helped fight fires on LST-472 and assisted in shooting down other planes before sailing again for Leyte at noon. With Mindoro in Allied hands, and air bases for the Luzon invasion under construction, Hopewell prepared for that operation, to be carried out initially at Lingayen Gulf. She sailed 4 January and fought off Japanese kamikaze attacks on the passage to Lingayen, for the landings 9 January joined the screen of an escort carrier group providing air cover. Hopewell joined in the amphibious assault on Corregidor 14 February, and while clearing obstructions from Mariveles Bay with gunfire engaged a large battery on ""the rock"".

Chimaji Appa ' s strategy was to go for the weakest link in the chain to the strongest , thereby progressively weakening the Portuguese . On 28 March 1737, Maratha forces led by Ranojirao Shinde and Shankarbuwa Shinde captured the strategic island fortress of Arnala, thus cutting off a crucial relief line to Vasai. Thane and Salsette Island were freed in 1737. In November 1738, Chimaji Appa captured the fort of Dahanu and on 20 January 1739, Mahim capitulated. This was speedily followed by the capture of the forts of Kelve/Mahim by Chengojirao shinde, Sirgão – by Ranojirao shinde, Tarapur – by Janojirao shinde, and Asserim on 13 February 1739 by Chimnajirao Peshwa self. On 28 March 1739 Portuguese lost the island and the fortress of Karanja to Raoloji Shinde's forces. Finally in February 1739, Chimaji Appa invaded Bassein Fort. He first occupied Versova fort., Dharavi and blockaded Bassein Creek. Then mines were laid at various points under the fort walls and detonated, causing a breach in the wall. As the Marathas including Ranojirao Shinde and his cousin grandfather Janojirao son of Shrimanat Changojirao poured into the fortress, the Portuguese fought on desperately and viciously, using their technically advanced weapons and artillery, they caused high casualties among the Marathas. Inch by inch the fort was secured and resistance contained in small pockets. At this stage the tower of Saint Sebastian collapsed in an explosion, and Portuguese morale plummeted. All resistance ceased immediately. On 16 May the Portuguese army surrendered. Portuguese Captain Caetano de Souza Pereira signed the surrender as most of the top army officers were already dead. Chimaji was magnanimous in victory, and surviving Portuguese were given a safe passage from the city. Portuguese were given eight days to take all their movable property and move out. Accordingly, the last remnants of Portuguese army and administration pulled out of Vasai by 23 May 1739. Great Maratha warrior Manajirao, alias Jankoji Shinde, son of Chengojirao Shinde (and father of Ranoji), killed Portuguese top official General Martinho da Sylveira, General Pedro de Mello and Lt. Colonel João Malhão. The Portuguese sources record that during the entire war with Chimaji Appa during 1737–1740, besides the Northern Province's capital Baçaim (Portuguese name for Vasai), they further lost eight cities, four chief ports, twenty fortress, two fortified hills and 340 villages. The losses amounted to nearly the whole of the Northern Provinces. To celebrate his victory and to fulfill a vow taken in front of Devi Vajreshwari, Chimaji appa had a temple built for the goddess nearby. The Vajreshwari Temple still stands there as a relic of Maratha glory. Chimaji Appa collected five large bells after he won in war against the Portuguese from Vasai Fort. He offered the bells at Bhimashankar, at Menavali near Wai in front of a Shiva Temple on the banks of the Krishna river, Banshanker temple( Pune), Omkareshwar Temple ( Pune) and Ramlinga temple Shirur.","Chimaji's strategy was to go for the weakest link in the chain to the strongest, thereby progressively weakening the Portuguese.","Chimaji Appa's strategy was to go for the weakest link in the chain to the strongest, thereby progressively weakening the Portuguese.",,

Novell announced the sale of Unix to the Santa Cruz Operation, coincident with a licensing arrangement with Hewlett Packard, in September 1995.

However Negus believes that in three crucial respects USL's actions – in continuing to release a source code product to its partners, in working to define industry standards such as POSIX, and in making decisions on the direction of Unix based on technical merit not corporate advantage – paved the way for the rise of a Unix-like entity such as the Linux operating system, and that this beneficial historical role has been obscured by the SCO–Linux controversies.","After The SCO Group went bankrupt, the SCO products using the Unix System V source base were purchased by UnXis, later renamed to Xinuos.","After The SCO Group went bankrupt, the SCO products using the Unix System V source base were purchased by UnXis, later renamed to Xinuos.",,

His father moved to Poland for financial reasons, yet he was known to have fervently held on to his German identity, often giving his sermons in German and dressing in modern German clothing. This ultimately had a great effect on R. Simcha Bunim, and was later used by his opponents, who portrayed him as an outsider because of his Germanic upbringing. Despite this, Simcha Bunim's father, though not Hasidic, was friends with many early Hasidic masters, such as R. Yisroel Hopstein of Kozhnitz and R. David of Lelov. He famously once received six rubles from R. Yaakov Yitzchak Horowitz of Lublin after he gave his insights on a verse in the Book of Isaiah in R. Yaakov Yitzchak's court in Lublin. Hasidic literature describes an intimate and loving relationship between R. Simcha Bunim and his father, partially motivated by the fact that R. Simcha Bunim was considered to have been an Illui (child prodigy). At age five, he reportedly expounded on the laws of hachnasat orchim (hospitality) before several of his father's guests.

un,"Spain–United Kingdom relations [HEAD] History ; Anglo-Portuguese Alliance [SEP] For centuries, the role of England, and subsequently Britain , in Iberia was coloured by the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance. Relations with Portugal always have been closer than those with Spain, and Spain and Britain have gone to war twice over Portugal's independence. In 1384, at the height of the Hundred Years' War, England provided reinforcements to King João I to thwart a French-backed Castilian invasion. These forces saw action at the decisive battle of Aljubarrota, and proved to be vital in securing the continued independence of Portugal from its larger neighbours. The alliance submerged into crisis when Portugal supported Joan of Castile instead of her aunt Isabella I of Castile during the War of the Castilian Succession of 1474–1479, because France also supported Joan's candidature. In the following years, the English collaborated with the Catholic Monarchs - Rodrigo González de la Puebla was sent to London as their first semi-permanent ambassador, their daughter Catharine of Aragon married Henry VII's sons Arthur and Henry and a small group of English soldiers even fought on the Castilian side during the conquest of Granada. However, the struggle of Elizabeth I of England against Philip II of Spain in the sixteenth century led to renewed English support of the Portuguese independence movement that started in 1640 with the crowning of King João IV of Portugal ). England's support for Portugal during their Restoration War further soured Anglo-Spanish relations. England nevertheless meditated the Treaty of Lisbon of 1668 between Portugal and Spain, which saw the independence of the former and the recognition of Pedro II as King. In following centuries, Portugal and Britain were closely allied in their politics and wars against Spain, which closely collaborated with France after the Spanish War of Succession (1700–1714) that established the House of Bourbon on the Spanish throne. The alliance was renewed in the face of Spain supporting France as an ally and the renewal of their Bourbon compact in the Seven years war. In this Spain agreed to attack Portugal and thus invaded in 1762 with a large army. British troops numbering near 10,000 came to aid the Portuguese. In spite of three attempts the Spanish along with their French ally were heavily defeated losing in total upwards of 25,000 men. After this Portugal and Spain both became allies during the Peninsula War. No further action between the powers took place until 1797 with the French Revolutionary wars. Once more Spain and France were allied against Portugal and Britain . The Napoleonic wars however saw Spain and Portugal along with Britain being allies in their fight against Napoleon.",Once more Spain and France were allied against Portugal and Britain.,Once more Spain and France were allied against Portugal and Britain.,,
done,"History of Korea [HEAD] Modern history ; Modern Korea (1953–present) [SEP] Beginning with Syngman Rhee in 1948, a series of autocratic governments took power in South Korea with American support and influence. With the coup of Park Chung-Hee in 1961, a new economic policy began. In order to promote economic development, a policy of export-oriented industrialization was applied. President Park developed the South Korean economy through a series of highly successful Five-Year Plans. South Korea's economic development was spearheaded by the chaebol, family conglomerates such as Samsung, Hyundai, SK Group, LG Corporation. The chaebol received state-backing via tax breaks and cheap loans, and took advantage of South Korea's inexpensive labor to produce exportable products. The government of South Korea made education a very high priority to create a well - educated populace capable of productively contributing to the economy . Despite occasional political instability, the Korean economy subsequently saw enormous growth for nearly forty years, in a period known as the Miracle on the Han River. The unparalleled economic miracle brought South Korea from one of the poorest states in the world after the Korean War into a fully developed country within a generation. South Korea eventually transitioned into a market-oriented democracy in 1987 largely due to popular demand for political reform, and then hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics, the second Summer Olympic Games to be held on the Asian continent, in the following year. Moving on from cheap, lower-value light industry exports, the South Korean economy eventually moved onto more capital-intensive, higher-value industries, such as information technology, shipbuilding, auto manufacturing, and petroleum refining. Today, South Korea is a leading economy and a technological powerhouse, rivaling even countries such as the United States in information and communication technology. South Korean pop culture has also boomed abroad in recent years, in a phenomenon known as the Korean Wave. Due to Soviet Influence, North Korea established a communist government with a hereditary succession of leadership, with ties to China and the Soviet Union. Kim Il-sung became the supreme leader until his death in 1994, after which his son, Kim Jong-il took power. Kim Jong-il's son, Kim Jong-un, is the current leader, taking power after his father's death in 2011. After the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991, the North Korean economy went on a path of steep decline, and it is currently heavily reliant on international food aid and trade with China.",The government made education a very high priority to create a well-educated populace capable of productively contributing to the economy.,The government of South Korea made education a very high priority to create a well-educated populace capable of productively contributing to the economy.,,
done,"Prince Edward Island [HEAD] Culture ; Arts [SEP] The island's cultural traditions of art, music and creative writing are supported through the public education system. There is an annual arts festival, the Charlottetown Festival, hosted at the Confederation Centre of the Arts. Lucy Maud Montgomery, who was born in Clifton (now New London) in 1874, wrote some 20 novels and numerous short stories that have been collected into anthologies. Her Lucy Maud Montgomery ' s first Anne book Anne of Green Gables was published in 1908 . The author Lucy Maud Montgomery drew inspiration from the land during the late Victorian Era for the setting of her classic novel Anne of Green Gables (1908). The musical play Anne of Green Gables has run every year at the Charlottetown festival for more than four decades. The sequel, Anne & Gilbert, premiered in the Playhouse in Victoria in 2005. The actual location of Green Gables, the house featured in Montgomery's Anne books, is in Cavendish, on the north shore of PEI. Elmer Blaney Harris founded an artists colony at Fortune Bridge and set his famous play Johnny Belinda on the island. Robert Harris was a well-known artist. Prince Edward Island's documented music history begins in the 19th century with religious music, some written by the local pump and block maker and organ-importer, Watson Duchemin. Several big bands including the Sons of Temperance Band and the Charlottetown Brass Band were active. Today, Acadian, Celtic, folk, and rock music prevail, with exponents including Gene MacLellan, his daughter Catherine MacLellan, Al Tuck, Lennie Gallant, Two Hours Traffic and Paper Lions. The celebrated singer-songwriter Stompin' Tom Connors spent his formative years in Skinners Pond. Celtic music is certainly the most common traditional music on the island, with fiddling and step dancing being very common. This tradition, largely Scottish, Irish and Acadian in origin is very similar to the music of Cape Breton and to a lesser extent, Newfoundland and is unique to the region. Due to the Islands influence as a former Highlander Clans Scottish colony, a March 4/4 for bagpipes was composed in honour of Prince Edward Island.",Her first Anne book Anne of Green Gables was published in 1908.,Lucy Maud Montgomery's first Anne book Anne of Green Gables was published in 1908.,,
done,"NASCAR Cup Series [HEAD] Cup cars [SEP] Cup Series cars (often called ""Cup cars"") adhere to a front engine rear-wheel-drive design. A roll cage serves as a space frame chassis and is covered by a 24-gauge sheet metal body. They have a closed cockpit, fenders, a rear spoiler, and an aerodynamic splitter. Fielding a car for one season usually costs $10–20 million. Each team may build its own cars and engines (per NASCAR's specifications) or purchase cars and engines from other teams. The cars are powered by EFI V8 engines since 2012 after 62 years using carburetion as engine fuel feed with compacted graphite iron blocks and pushrod valvetrains actuating two-valves per cylinder, and are limited to 358 cubic inches' (about 5.8 liters) displacement. However, modern technology has allowed power outputs near 900 horsepower (670 kW) in unrestricted form while retaining the conventional basic engine design. In fact, before NASCAR instituted the gear rule, Cup engines were capable of operating more than 10,000 rpm. A NASCAR Cup Series engine with the maximum bore of 4.185 inches (106 millimeters) and stroke of 3.25 inches (83 millimeters) at 9,000 rpm has a mean piston speed of 80.44 fps (24.75 m/s). Contemporary Cup engines run 9,800 rpm, 87.59 fps (26.95 m/s), at the road course events, on Pocono Raceway's long front stretch, and at Martinsville Speedway (a .526-mile short-track). At the backbone 1.5- to 2.0-mile tri-oval tracks of NASCAR, the engines produce over 850 hp running 9,200-9,400 rpm for 500 miles, 600 mi for the Coca-Cola 600 Charlotte race. The current NASCAR Cup engines curb weight is roughly at 575 lb (261 kg). The front suspension is a double wishbone design, while the rear suspension is a two-link live axle design utilizing trailing arms. Brake rotors must be made of magnetic cast iron or steel and may not exceed 12.72 inches (32.3 centimeters) in diameter. The only aerodynamic components on the vehicles are the front splitter, spoiler, NACA ducts in the windows only, and side skirts. The use of rear diffusers , vortex generators , canards , wheel well vents , hood vents , and undertrays is strictly prohibited in the NASCAR Cup Series . While the cars may reach speeds of about 200 mph (320 km/h) on certain tracks, Russ Wicks drove a stock car built to NASCAR's specifications 244.9 mph (394.1 km/h) during a speed record attempt at the Bonneville Salt Flats in October 2007. NASCAR Cup Series engines carry a Freescale-provided electronic control unit, but traction control and anti-lock brakes are prohibited. Live telemetry is used only for television broadcasts, but the data can be recorded from the ECU to the computer if the car is in the garage and not on the track. Cup cars are required to have at least one working windshield wiper installed on the car for the three road courses (Sonoma, Watkins Glen, and the Roval at the Charlotte Motor Speedway) as part of the road racing rules package.","The use of rear diffusers, vortex generators, canards, wheel well vents, hood vents, and undertrays is strictly prohibited.","The use of rear diffusers, vortex generators, canards, wheel well vents, hood vents, and undertrays is strictly prohibited in the NASCAR Cup Series.",,
imp,"Warp (2012 video game) [HEAD] Gameplay [SEP] Despite being a 3D game, the gameplay remains similar to a top-down 2D game that features puzzle solving and stealth. The first power Zero acquires is the ability to teleport short distances, also known as the titular Warp. Zero is able to warp through open spaces, through objects, into objects, and into living things. The speed between warps is dependent on whether Zero moves into an object or into open space. Moving into open space gives Zero a slight timed penalty before it can warp again. From inside an object (or person), Zero can move around vigorously and eventually make it explode. This is known as a Frag. Guards, scientists, and turrets attempt to stop Zero's escape. Upon sight of Zero both turrets and guards will attempt to shoot, while scientists will cower and run away. Once spotted by one human they will most likely alert other humans of Zero's presence. Alarms that are activated can be turned off by destroying the alarm coil or moving it off the alarm pad. Sound and sight also play a prominent role in the game. Zero is about half the size of the average human and so is able to hide behind many objects that are scattered across the map without being seen. Sound will also alert the guards to Zero's presence. Footsteps, knocking into objects, and Zero's powers will create sounds audible to the human ears prompting an investigation, though many of these sounds can be made inaudible through upgrades. Upgrades can be purchased at stations throughout the game. Upgrades cost grub energy that has been collected throughout Zero's journey. Grubs are small parasite-like creatures that cling to objects and give off a purple glow. This glow makes them easier to spot, although many of these grubs are located in hard to reach places and require extra skill or more powers to reach. Once a grub is found, Zero consumes it and absorbs its energy. Zero will come across puddles of water early on in the game and discovers that being exposed to small amounts of water will nullify his powers temporarily. This is indicated by Zero having a sudden loss of color and a different walking animation. Unfortunately for Zero, the scientists also discover this weakness. They exploit this weakness by creating a malleable water substance that they primarily use as a shield. Zero can't walk, warp, echo, or use a hologram to get past these shields. When exposed to large quantities of water , Zero will die . The facility is located underwater. Throughout the game, Zero will find remains of other aliens and will be able to absorb their old powers in order to aid his escape. The second power Zero unlocks is a solid hologram, known as Echo. Zero's echo ghost will move independently from him, but Zero is unable to move when this power is activated. All enemies can see Zero's echo but they can't tell it apart from the real Zero. If Zero's echo is killed, it will dissipate. The hologram can pass through all objects and move across gaps but will also dissipate when it comes into contact with water. The echo's movement is restricted to within a certain radius around Zero's position. When Zero activates this power inside an object, the hologram will take on the image and properties of the object. Guards, scientists, and turrets will only notice the object if it is not stationary. When Zero activates this power inside a person, whether the human is alive or dead, the echo will be of that person walking and enemies won't notice anything wrong.","When exposed to large quantities of water, Zero will die.","When exposed to large quantities of water, Zero will die.",,

He was a member of one of the national volunteer battalions created on the outbreak of the French Revolution. He was made chef de bataillon adjudant-général in November 1794 and fought with distinction in several actions of the Italian campaign in 1796. He was often mentioned in dispatches by general Augereau. On 13 June 1795 he came off the list of active officers and in February 1796 he was drafted back into the army for home service, though he returned to Augereau and Italy in August 1796, fighting at Mantua, Rivoli and La Favorita.

un,"Cellular respiration [HEAD] Fermentation [SEP] Without oxygen , pyruvate ( pyruvic acid ) is not metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation . The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to waste products that may be removed from the cell. This serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate. Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD+ so it can be re-used in glycolysis. In the absence of oxygen, fermentation prevents the buildup of NADH in the cytoplasm and provides NAD+ for glycolysis. This waste product varies depending on the organism. In skeletal muscles, the waste product is lactic acid. This type of fermentation is called lactic acid fermentation. In strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD+ regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate. Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen. During recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD+ attaches to hydrogen from lactate to form ATP. In yeast, the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide. This type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or ethanol fermentation. The ATP generated in this process is made by substrate-level phosphorylation, which does not require oxygen. Fermentation is less efficient at using the energy from glucose: only 2 ATP are produced per glucose, compared to the 38 ATP per glucose nominally produced by aerobic respiration. This is because most of the energy of aerobic respiration derives from O2 with its relatively weak, high-energy double bond. Glycolytic ATP, however, is created more quickly. For prokaryotes to continue a rapid growth rate when they are shifted from an aerobic environment to an anaerobic environment, they must increase the rate of the glycolytic reactions. For multicellular organisms, during short bursts of strenuous activity, muscle cells use fermentation to supplement the ATP production from the slower aerobic respiration, so fermentation may be used by a cell even before the oxygen levels are depleted, as is the case in sports that do not require athletes to pace themselves, such as sprinting.","Without oxygen, pyruvate (pyruvic acid) is not metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation.","Without oxygen, pyruvate (pyruvic acid) is not metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation.",,

imp,"Keep It Natural [HEAD] Background [SEP] The band formed in 1999, when future members Marc Terenzi and Ben Bledsoe met at a party. Terenzi and Bledsoe met future bandmates Patrick King and Michael Johnson at an industry party. The four got together and after subsequent members joined and left, settled on fifth member Michael Horn, who Bledsoe had found through his vocal coach. The five young men tried to get signed to record label on their own, but ended up being turned down by most of the major labels. They originally worked with manager Veit Renn and recorded several songs. However, the band, eventually frustrated, turned to Lou Pearlman, who had had success with some of the biggest boy bands in the world. Renn was not pleased with this and sued . The outcome of the case is unknown, though the band did eventually stay with Pearlman. The band was signed under Transcontinental Records and released albums under that label in the United States, and Sony BMG abroad. Unlike most boy bands who are vocal groups, the members of Natural all played instruments. Renn claims he was the one who insisted they learn instruments, spending $75,000 on their training. However certain members such as Horn and Terenzi claim they had been playing since childhood. Bledsoe played bass and was one of the lead vocalists, while Terenzi played guitar, as well as being the second lead vocalist. Horn became J Horn, to avoid confusion. He played piano, and was the final lead vocalist, though in subsequent years as he withdrew from the band he was featured less, while Patrick King also played guitar, and Johnson played the drums. The band realized that they couldn't promote themselves very easily without having to bring their instruments with them everywhere they went, so they started performing a cappella versions of their music. This method was successful, as their first show at the House of Blues in Orlando, FL was completely sold out. Soon after, they kept building, by Bledsoe learning how to beat box and do vocal bass lines within the band, in the a cappella setting. Then, after realizing that both Johnson and King had extensive training in dance, the band added a few up tempo Rock style dance songs to their set. These were only seen on their tours, as it was a way to keep the show changing and more interesting. They would also switch instruments to allow one singer to have more front time for a specific song. In the summer of 2000, Pearlman hired Steve Kipner to write Natural's first single, ""Put Your Arms Around Me"". He also struck a deal with teenage accessories store Claire's. The store sold the single as an extra with a $12 or more purchase. A join tour with The Monkees in conjunction with Claire's followed. However, the single never actually charted on the Billboard Hot 100. The single became #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 Single Sales Chart, yet that had little impact on the general public. Natural attempted promotions in the United States several times in the next few years, though sporadically. Such promotions included several interviews and features in POPstar Magazine, performing in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade 2001, performing medley tribute to the Bee Gees as part of ABC's 'Disco Ball' in 2003, and at one point a mall tour with Saks Fifth Avenue, they still never charted or had successful radio play outside of Orlando.",Renn was not pleased with this and sued.,Renn was not pleased with this and sued.,,

Wardynski envisioned ""using computer game technology to provide the public a virtual soldier experience that was engaging, informative and entertaining"". America's Army was managed by two other U.S. Army officers serving with Wardynski at the Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis (OEMA): Major Chris Chambers and Major Brett Wilson. Wardynski approached Michael Zyda and Michael Capps at the Naval Postgraduate School's (NPS) MOVES Institute in Monterey, California, to make this video game vision a reality. Zyda and Capps took a unique approach for developing a major software project in the United States Department of Defense by assembling a team of professional game developers with experience developing major titles and creating a development studio on the campus of NPS. The project had a development budget of $5 million. The game was developed by Wardynski who recognized that a video game might be helpful to the U.S. Army in the strategic communication efforts by providing more information to prospective soldiers and to help reduce the number of recruits who wash out during the nine weeks of basic training. The effort proved successful as more than 13 million players have registered America's Army accounts over the years, with more than 260 million hours played on the various titles. One teenager was quoted saying the game ""provides great information. This would probably spark an interest. I don't know how I would have found out so much some other way."" America's Army developers licensed commercial game engine technology, specifically the Unreal game engine, as the foundation for its game. It was the first game to feature Unreal Engine 2. America's Army is intended to give a positive impression of the U.S. Army. In the official page the developers confirmed in a statement that one of the reasons people outside the United States can play the game is ""We want the whole world to know how great the U.S. Army is."" America's Army is the first well-known overt use of computer games for political aims. Chris Chambers, the former deputy director of development for America's Army, admits it is a recruitment tool, and Chris Morris of CNN/Money states that ""the Army readily admits [America's Army] is a propaganda device"".

In 1917, Guénon began a one-year stay at Sétif, Algeria, teaching philosophy to college students. After World War I, he left teaching to dedicate his energies to writing; his first book, Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines, was published in 1921. From 1925 Guénon became a contributor to a review edited by P. Chacornac, Le Voile d'Isis (""The Veil of Isis""); after 1935 and under Guénon's influence, this periodical became known as Les Études Traditionnelles (""Traditional Studies""). Although the exposition of Hindu doctrines to European audiences had already been attempted in piecemeal fashion at that time by many orientalists, Guénon's Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines advanced its subject in a uniquely insightful manner, by referring to the concepts of metaphysics and Tradition in their most general sense, which Guénon precisely defined, along with the necessary distinctions and definitions of seemingly unambiguous terms such as religion, tradition, exoterism, esoterism and theology. Guénon explained that his purpose was not to describe all aspects of Hinduism, but to give the necessary intellectual foundation for a proper understanding of its spirit. The book also stands as a harsh condemnation of works presented by certain other European writers about Hinduism and Tradition in general; according to Guénon, such writers had lacked any profound understanding of their subject matter and of its implications. The book also contains a critical analysis of the political intrusions of the British Empire into the subject of Hinduism (and India itself) through Madame Blavatsky's Theosophy. The publication of this book earned him rapid recognition in Parisian circles. René Grousset in his "" History of Eastern Philosophy "" ( 1923 ) already referred to René Guénon ' s work as a “classic” . André Malraux would say much later that it was, ""At its date, a book capital"". On the other hand, Guénon was very disappointed by the reaction of his neo-Thomist friends, Noëlle Maurice-Denis and his erstwhile supporter Jacques Maritain argued that Guénon's views were ""radically irreconcilable with the [Catholic] faith""; he called them a ""Hinduist restoration of ancient Gnosis, mother of heresies"". Jacques Maritain, when he became French Ambassador to the Vatican after World War II, asked for Guénon's work listed under the Catholic Index of Prohibited Books, a request which did not result due to the refusal of Pius XII and the support of Cardinal Eugène Tisserant.","René Grousset in his ""History of Eastern Philosophy"" (1923) already referred to Guénon's work as a “classic”.","René Grousset in his ""History of Eastern Philosophy"" (1923) already referred to René Guénon's work as a “classic”.",,

done,"Team Buddies [HEAD] Gameplay [SEP] The game is a mix of Worms' humour and a typical real-time strategy game. Central to the game's theme is the ability of a team of buddies to stack crates in a 2×2×2 pad located in their starting area. Stacking the crates in different ways make different items when the resulting larger crate is broken; for example, a single crate on a stacking pad produces a light weapon, four crates positioned horizontally makes a heavy weapon, and filling the pad creates a vehicle. The battle toys created are based on the selected world, and there are eight original worlds, plus many special sets unlocked once players complete story mode. Most vehicles can carry two crates, but larger vehicles (and the golf cart) can carry three. Up to three additional team members can also be created by stacking crates directly on top of each other; these new ""buddies"" can be commanded to attack or defend a certain area or even build on the stacking pad on their own. The player can swap between any of the buddies under his or her control in order to make use of that particular unit's powers or weapons. In addition to a stacking pad, each starting point has a large base building which can be attacked and destroyed. If a base is destroyed, the stacking pad for that team can no longer be used; this means that new members cannot be created, making destroying the base a top priority for securing victory. A team without a base is also unable to build new weapons and must rely on those dropped by the enemy or found around the map (although a fast unit can steal a weapon from an enemy pad as it is being opened). A typical map of Team Buddies will have various "" crate drop "" areas ( in most cases a small area at the players base and a much larger spawn in the middle of the map ) , where the crates used to build weapons and team - mates fall from the sky . Most crates in the game are yellow with red borders, but yellow crates with blue borders also drop from time to time. Adding one of these to a crate formation causes the object or unit created by it to have increased abilities; for example, a higher rate of fire or range for a weapon or more hit points for a unit or vehicle. In certain maps, mega-crates also drop if certain conditions are met; these large, grey and yellow crates contain a weapon or vehicle not normally found in that particular area, and can be towed behind a Mech, but not behind other vehicles. Team Buddies also supports split-screen multi-player for up to four players. There are several different game types in multi-player:","A typical map will have various ""crate drop"" areas (in most cases a small area at the players base and a much larger spawn in the middle of the map), where the crates used to build weapons and team-mates fall from the sky.","A typical map of Team Buddies will have various ""crate drop"" areas (in most cases a small area at the players base and a much larger spawn in the middle of the map), where the crates used to build weapons and team-mates fall from the sky.",,
un,"Acid [HEAD] Biological occurrence [SEP] Many biologically important molecules are acids. Nucleic acids, which contain acidic phosphate groups, include DNA and RNA. Nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organism's characteristics, and is passed from parents to offspring. DNA contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of proteins which are made up of amino acid subunits. Cell membranes contain fatty acid esters such as phospholipids. An α-amino acid has a central carbon (the α or alpha carbon) which is covalently bonded to a carboxyl group (thus they are carboxylic acids), an amino group, a hydrogen atom and a variable group. The variable group, also called the R group or side chain, determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid. In glycine, the simplest amino acid, the R group is a hydrogen atom, but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens, and may contain other elements such as sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen. With the exception of glycine, naturally occurring amino acids are chiral and almost invariably occur in the L-configuration. Peptidoglycan, found in some bacterial cell walls contains some D-amino acids. At physiological pH, typically around 7, free amino acids exist in a charged form, where the acidic carboxyl group (-COOH) loses a proton (-COO−) and the basic amine group (-NH2) gains a proton (-NH+3). The entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a zwitterion, with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains. Aspartic acid, for example, possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups, for a net charge of −1 at physiological pH. Fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology. These contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end. The cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a phospholipid bilayer, a micelle of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar, hydrophilic phosphate ""head"" groups. Membranes contain additional components, some of which can participate in acid–base reactions. In humans and many other animals, hydrochloric acid is a part of the gastric acid secreted within the stomach to help hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides, as well as converting the inactive pro-enzyme, pepsinogen into the enzyme, pepsin. Some organisms produce acids for defense; for example, ants produce formic acid. Acid–base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating mammalian breathing . Oxygen gas (O2) drives cellular respiration, the process by which animals release the chemical potential energy stored in food, producing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a byproduct. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs, and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of ventilation. For example, during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored carbohydrates and fat, releasing CO2 into the blood stream. In aqueous solutions such as blood CO2 exists in equilibrium with carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion. It is the decrease in pH that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper, expelling the excess CO2 and resupplying the cells with O2.",Acid–base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating mammalian breathing.,Acid–base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating mammalian breathing.,,

un,"Horseshoe kidney [HEAD] Pathophysiology [SEP] Kidneys are normally located in the retroperitoneal space between the T12 and L3 vertebrae after ascending from the pelvis during development to rest underneath the adrenal glands. In patients with this condition, the horseshoe kidney ascent is commonly arrested by the inferior mesenteric artery due to the central fusion of the kidneys. However, this is present in only 40% of cases, and, in 20% of cases, the fused kidney remains in the pelvis. Its ascension may also be restricted by its own renal artery. Additionally, during normal development, the kidneys undergo a 90 degree medial rotation while ascending. However, due to the renal fusion, this rotation is impaired resulting in abnormal placement of the ureters. This in turn can lead to urinary stasis and drainage issues. Furthermore, approximately 70% of kidneys in normal individuals are supplied by a single renal artery with the remaining 30% having embryonic collateral or accessory arteries. With horseshoe kidneys , the majority are supplied by derivatives of the abdominal aorta or common illiac arteries depending on the final position of the kidneys .

un,"Novgorod Oblast [HEAD] History [SEP] Towards the end of the 15th century Novgorod was defeated by the army of Ivan III, the prince of Moscow, and was included into the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In 1560, Ivan the Terrible, fearing treason, sent his army to sack the city. This event, known as the Massacre of Novgorod, had catastrophic consequences for the city, which lost the majority of its population and never recovered. Additionally, in the beginning of the 17th century, during the Time of Troubles, as Novgorod was plundered by the Swedish army. December 29 [O.S. December 18], 1708 Tsar Peter the Great issued an edict which established seven governorates. The present area of Novgorod oblast was a part of Ingermanland Governorate, which was renamed Saint Petersburg Governorate in 1710. In 1727, a separate Novgorod Governorate was established. It was subdivided into five provinces, and the current area of Novgorod Oblast was split between two of them—Novgorod and Velikiye Luki Provinces. In 1772, Velikiye Luki Province was transferred to newly established Pskov Governorate. In 1775, Novgorod Governorate was transformed to Novgorod Viceroyalty, and in 1777, Pskov Governorate was transformed to Pskov Viceroyalty. In 1796, both governorates were re-established. By the 1920s, most of the area of current Novgorod Oblast belonged to Novgorod Governorate. Before the 19th century, the areas around Novgorod were considerably better developed than the areas which are currently located in the center and the east of the oblast. In 1851, Moscow – Saint Petersburg Railway, the first long-distance railway in Russia, opened. It bypassed Novgorod as it was built on a straight line between Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The railway construction lead to the development of the adjacent areas and eventually to creation of new towns such as Malaya Vishera, Okulovka, and Chudovo. Later on, the railroads between Sonkovo and Saint Petersburg, as well as between Bologoye and Pskov, and a number of connecting lines, were constructed. On August 1, 1927 the governorates were abolished, and merged into newly established Leningrad Oblast. Between autumn of 1941 and spring of 1944 , during World War II , western parts of the current area of Novgorod Oblast , including the city of Novgorod , were occupied by German troops . Novgorod oblast was an area of long and fierce battles, such as, for example, the Demyansk Pocket, or the Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive in 1944, when the Soviet troops crossed the Volkhov River. After the liberation, on July 5, 1944, Novgorod Oblast with the center in the city of Novgorod was established.","Between autumn of 1941 and spring of 1944, during World War II, western parts of the current area of Novgorod Oblast, including the city of Novgorod, were occupied by German troops.","Between autumn of 1941 and spring of 1944, during World War II, western parts of the current area of Novgorod Oblast, including the city of Novgorod, were occupied by German troops.",,
